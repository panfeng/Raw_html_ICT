<h4 class="calibre15">(2.) Berkshire</h4>

<p class="title"><em class="calibre11">Beenham. </em>In June, 1864, a man, his wife and 4 children lived in a
cot (one-storied cottage). A daughter came home from service with scarlet
fever. She died. One child sickened and died. The mother and one child were
down with typhus when Dr. Hunter was called in. The father and one child slept
outside, but the difficulty of securing isolation was seen here, for in the
crowded market of the miserable village lay the linen of the fever-stricken
household, waiting for the wash. The rent of H.’s house, 1s. a-week; one
bedroom for man, wife, and 6 children. One house let for 8d. a-week, 14 feet 6
inches long, 7 feet broad, kitchen, 6 feet high; the bedroom without window,
fire-place, door, or opening, except into the lobby; no garden. A man lived
here for a little while, with two grown-up daughters and one grown-up son;
father and son slept on the bed, the girls in the passage. Each of the latter
had a child while the family was living here, but one went to the workhouse for
her confinement and then came home. </p>

<h4 class="calibre15">(3.) Buckinghamshire</h4>

<p class="title">30 cottages — on 1,000 acres of land — contained here about
130-140 persons. The parish of <em class="calibre11">Bradenham</em> comprises 1,000 acres; it
numbered, in 1851, 36 houses and a population of 84 males and 54 females. This
inequality of the sexes was partly remedied in 1861, when they numbered 98
males and 87 females; increase in 10 years of 14 men and 33 women. Meanwhile,
the number of houses was one less. </p>

<p class="title"><em class="calibre11">Winslow. </em>Great part of this newly built in good style; demand for
houses appears very marked, since very miserable cots let at 1s. to 1s. 3d. per
week. </p>

<p class="title"><em class="calibre11">Water Eaton. </em>Here the landlords, in view of the increasing
population, have destroyed about 20 per cent. of the existing houses. A poor
labourer, who had to go about 4 miles to his work, answered the question,
whether he could not find a cot nearer: “No; they know better than to
take a man in with my large family.” </p>

<p class="title"> <em class="calibre11">Tinker’s End,</em> near Winslow. A bedroom in which were 4 adults
and 4 children; 11 feet long, 9 feet broad, 6 feet 5 inches high at its highest
part; another 11 feet 3 inches by 9 feet, 5 feet 10 inches high, sheltered 6
persons. Each of these families had less space than is considered necessary for
a convict. No house had more than one bedroom, not one of them a back-door;
water very scarce; weekly rent from 1s. 4d. to 2s. In 16 of the houses visited,
only 1 man that earned 10s. a-week. The quantity of air for each person under
the circumstances just described corresponds to that which he would have if he
were shut up in a box of 4 feet measuring each way, the whole night. But then,
the ancient dens afforded a certain amount of unintentional ventilation. </p>

<h4 class="calibre15">(4.) Cambridgeshire</h4>

<p class="title"><em class="calibre11">Gamblingay</em> belongs to several landlords. It contains the
wretchedest cots to be found anywhere. Much straw-plaiting. “A deadly
lassitude, a hopeless surrendering up to filth,” reigns in Gamblingay.
The neglect in its centre, becomes mortification at its extremities, north and
south, where the houses are rotting to pieces. The absentee landlords bleed
this poor rookery too freely. The rents are very high; 8 or 9 persons packed in
one sleeping apartment, in 2 cases 6 adults, each with 1 or 2 children in one
small bedroom. </p>

<h4 class="calibre15">(5.) Essex</h4>

<p class="title">In this county, diminutions in the number of persons and of cottages go, in
many parishes, hand in hand. In not less than 22 parishes, however, the
destruction of houses has not prevented increase of population, or has not
brought about that expulsion which, under the name “migration to
towns,” generally occurs. In Fingringhoe, a parish of 3,443 acres, were
in 1851, 145 houses; in 1861, only 110. But the people did not wish to go away,
and managed even to increase under these circumstances. In 1851, 252 persons
inhabited 61 houses, but in 1861, 262 persons were squeezed into 49 houses. In
Basilden, in 1851, 157 persons lived on 1,827 acres, in 35 houses; at the end
of ten years, 180 persons in 27 houses. In the parishes of Fingringhoe, South
Fambridge, Widford, Basilden, and Ramsden Crags, in 1851, 1,392 persons were
living on 8,449 acres in 316 houses; in 1861, on the same area, 1,473 persons
in 249 houses. </p>

<h4 class="calibre15">(6.) Herefordshire</h4>

<p class="title">This little county has suffered more from the “eviction-spirit”
than any other in England. At Nadby, overcrowded cottages generally, with only
2 bedrooms, belonging for the most part to the farmers. They easily let them
for £3 or £4 a-year, and paid a weekly wage of 9s. </p>

<h4 class="calibre15">(7) Huntingdon</h4>

<p class="title"><em class="calibre11">Hartford</em> had, in 1851, 87 houses; shortly after this, 19 cottages
were destroyed in this small parish of 1,720 acres; population in 1831, 452; in
1852, 382; and in 1861, 341. 14 cottages, each with 1 bedroom, were visited. In
one, a married couple, 3 grown-up sons, 1 grown-up daughter, 4 children —
in all 10 in another, 3 adults, 6 children. One of these rooms, in which 8
people slept, was 12 feet 10 inches long, 12 feet 2 inches broad, 6 feet 9
inches high: the average, without making any deduction for projections into the
apartment, gave about 130 cubic feet per head. In the 14 sleeping rooms, 34
adults and 33 children. These cottages are seldom provided with gardens, but
many of the inmates are able to farm small allotments at 10s. or 12s. per rood.
These allotments are at a distance from the houses, which are without privies.
The family “must either go to the allotment to deposit their
ordures,” or, as happens in this place, saving your presence, “use
a closet with a trough set like a drawer in a chest of drawers, and drawn out
weekly and conveyed to the allotment to be emptied where its contents were
wanted.” In Japan, the circle of life-conditions moves more decently than
this. </p>

<h4 class="calibre15">(8) Lincolnshire</h4>

<p class="title"><em class="calibre11">Langtoft. </em>A man lives here, in Wright’s house, with his wife,
her mother, and 5 children; the house has a front kitchen, scullery, bedroom
over the front kitchen; front kitchen and bedroom, 12 feet 2 inches by 9 feet 5
inches; the whole ground floor, 21 feet 2 inches by 9 feet 5 inches. The
bedroom is a garret: the walls run together into the roof like a sugar-loaf, a
dormer-window opening in front. “Why did he live here? On account of the
garden? No; it is very small. Rent? High, 1s. 3d. per week. Near his work? No;
6 miles away, so that he walks daily, to and fro, 12 miles. He lived there,
because it was a tenantable cot,” and because he wanted to have a cot for
himself alone, anywhere, at any price, and in any conditions. The following are
the statistics of 12 houses in Langtoft, with 12 bedrooms, 38 adults, and 36
children. </p>

<p class="title"><em class="calibre11">Brinworth, Pickford and Floore:</em> in these villages in the winter
2030 men were lounging about the streets from want of work. The farmers do not
always till sufficiently the corn and turnip lands, and the landlord has found
it best to throw all his farms together into 2 or 3. Hence want of employment.
Whilst on one side of the wall, the land calls for labour, on the other side
the defrauded labourers are casting at it longing glances. Feverishly
overworked in summer, and half-starved in winter, it is no wonder if they say
in their peculiar dialect, “the parson and gentlefolk seem frit to death
at them.” </p>

<p class="title">At Floore, instances, in one bedroom of the smallest size, of couples with
4, 5, 6 children; 3 adults with 5 children; a couple with grandfather and 6
children down with scarlet fever, &amp;c.; in two houses with two bedrooms, two

nothing good about it, except the walls, from the floor of rough-hewn pieces of
stones to the roof of worn-out thatch. </p>

<h4 class="calibre15">(12.) Worcestershire</h4>

<p class="title">House-destruction here not quite so excessive; yet from 1851 to 1861, the
number of inhabitants to each house on the average, has risen from 4.2 to 4.6.
</p>

<p class="title"><em class="calibre11">Badsey. </em>Many cots and little gardens here. Some of the farmers
declare that the cots are “a great nuisance here, because they bring the
poor.” On the statement of one gentleman:</p>

<p class="title">“The poor are none the better for them; if you build
500 they will let fast enough, in fact, the more you build, the more they
want” </p>

<p class="title">(according to him the houses give birth to the inhabitants, who then by a
law of Nature press on “the means of housing”). Dr. Hunter
remarks:</p>

<p class="title">“Now these poor must come from somewhere, and as there
is no particular attraction, such as doles, at Badsey, it must be repulsion
from some other unfit place, which will send them here. If each could find an
allotment near his work, he would not prefer Badsey, where he pays for his
scrap of ground twice as much as the farmer pays for his.” </p>

<p class="title">The continual emigration to the towns, the continual formation of surplus
population in the country through the concentration of farms, conversion of
arable land into pasture, machinery, &amp;c., and the continual eviction of the
agricultural population by the destruction of their cottages, go hand in hand.
The more empty the district is of men, the greater is its “relative
surplus population,” <a name="107a" class="calibre14" id="107a"></a>the greater is their pressure on
the means of employment, the greater is the absolute excess of the agricultural
population over the means for housing it, the greater, therefore, in the
villages is the local surplus population and the most pestilential packing
together of human beings. The packing together of knots of men in scattered
little villages and small country towns corresponds to the forcible draining of
men from the surface of the land. The continuous superseding of the
agricultural labourers, in spite of their diminishing number and the increasing
mass of their products, gives birth to their pauperism. Their pauperism is
ultimately a motive to their eviction and the chief source of their miserable
housing which breaks down their last power of resistance. and makes them more
slaves of the landed <!--648-->proprietors and the farmers. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch25_split_001.htm#n107" class="calibre1">[107]</a></sup> Thus the minimum of wages becomes
a law of Nature<a name="108a" class="calibre14" id="108a"></a> to them. On the other hand, the land, in
spite of its constant “relative surplus population,” is at the same
time underpopulated. This is seen, not only locally at the points where the
efflux of men to towns, mines, railroad-making, &amp;c., is most marked. It is
to be seen everywhere, in harvest-time as well as in spring and summer, at
those frequently recurring times when English agriculture, so careful and
intensive, wants extra hands. There are always too many agricultural labourers
for the ordinary, and always too few for the exceptional or temporary needs of
the cultivation of the soil. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch25_split_001.htm#n108" class="calibre1">[108]</a></sup>
“Hence we find in the official documents<a name="109a" class="calibre14" id="109a"></a> contradictory
complaints from the same places of deficiency and excess of labour
simultaneously. The temporary or local want of labour brings about no rise in
wages, but a forcing of the women and children into the fields, and
exploitation at an age constantly lowered. As soon as the exploitation of the
women and children takes place on a larger scale, it becomes in turn a new
means of making a surplus population of the male agricultural labourer and of
keeping down his wage. In the east of England thrives a beautiful fruit of this
vicious<!--649--> circle — the so-called gang-system, to which I must
briefly return here. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch25_split_001.htm#n109" class="calibre1">[109]</a></sup></p>

<p class="title">The gang system obtains almost exclusively in the counties of Lincoln,
Huntingdon, Cambridge, Norfolk, Suffolk, and Nottingham, here and there in the
neighbouring counties of Northampton, Bedford, and Rutland. Lincolnshire will
serve us as an example. A large part of this county is new land, marsh
formerly, or even, as in others of the eastern counties just named, won lately
from the sea. The steam-engine has worked wonders in the way of drainage. What
were once fens and sandbanks, bear now a luxuriant sea of corn and the highest
of rents. The same thing holds of the alluvial lands won by human endeavour, as
in the island of Axholme and other parishes on the banks of the Trent. In
proportion as the new farms arose, not only were no new cottages built: old
ones were demolished, and the supply of labour had to come from open villages,
miles away, by long roads that wound along the sides of the hills. There alone
had the population formerly found shelter from the incessant floods of the
winter-time. The labourers that dwell on the farms of 400-1,000 acres <a name="110a" class="calibre14" id="110a"></a>(they are called “confined labourers”) are solely
employed on such kinds of agricultural work as is permanent, difficult, and
carried on by aid of horses. For every 100 acres there is, on an average,
scarcely one cottage. A fen farmer, e.g., gave evidence before the Commission
of Inquiry:</p>

<p class="title">“I farm 320 acres, all arable land. I have not one
cottage on my farm. I have only one labourer on my farm now. I have four
horsemen lodging about. We get light work done by gangs.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch25_split_001.htm#n110" class="calibre1">[110]</a></sup></p>

<p class="title">The soil requires much light field labour, such as weeding, hoeing, certain
processes of manuring, removing of stones, &amp;c. This is done by the gangs,
or organised bands that dwell in the open villages. <a name="111a" class="calibre14" id="111a"></a></p>

<p class="title">The gang consists of 10 to 40 or 50 persons, women, young persons of both
sexes (13-18 years of age, although the boys are for the most part eliminated
at the age of 13), and children of both sexes (6-13 years of age). At the head
is the gang master, always an ordinary agricultural labourer, generally what is
called a bad lot, a scapegrace, unsteady, drunken, but with a dash of
enterprise and <em class="calibre11">savoir-faire</em>. He is the recruiting-sergeant for the
gang, which works under him, not under the farmer. He generally arranges with
the latter for piece-work, and his income, which on the average is not very
much above that of an ordinary agricultural labourer, <sup class="enote"><a href="ch25_split_001.htm#n111" class="calibre1">[111]</a></sup> depends almost entirely upon the
dexterity <!--650-->with which he manages to extract within the shortest time
the greatest possible amount of labour from his gang. The farmers have
discovered that women work steadily only under the direction of men, but that
women and children, once set going, impetuously spend their life-force —
as Fourier knew — while the adult male labourer is shrewd enough to
economise his as much as he can. The gang-master goes from one farm to another,
and thus employs his gang from 6 to 8 months in the year. Employment by him is,
therefore, much more lucrative and more certain for the labouring families,
than employment by the individual farmer, who only employs children
occasionally. This circumstance so completely rivets his influence in the open
villages that children are generally only to be hired through his
instrumentality. The lending out of these individually, independently of the
gang, is his second trade. <a name="112a" class="calibre14" id="112a"></a></p>

<p class="title">The “drawbacks” of the system are the overwork of the children
and young persons, the enormous marches that they make daily to and from the
farms, 5, 6, and sometimes 7 miles distant, finally, the demoralisation of the
gang. Although the gang-master, who, in some districts is called “the
driver,” is armed with a long stick, he uses it but seldom, and
complaints of brutal treatment are exceptional. He is a democratic emperor, or
a kind of Pied Piper of Hamelin. He must therefore be popular with his
subjects, and he binds them to himself by the charms of the gipsy life under
his direction. Coarse freedom, a noisy jollity, and obscenest impudence give
attractions to the gang. Generally the gangmaster pays up in a public house;
then he returns home at the head of the procession reeling drunk, propped up
right and left by a stalwart virago, while children and young persons bring up
the rear, boisterous, and singing chaffing and bawdy songs. On the return
journey what Fourier calls “phanerogamie,” is the order of the day.
The getting with child of girls of 13 and 14 by their male companions of the
same age, is common. The open villages which supply the contingent of the gang,
become Sodoms and Gomorrahs, <sup class="enote"><a href="ch25_split_001.htm#n112" class="calibre1">[112]</a></sup>
and have twice as high a rate of illegitimate births as the rest of the
kingdom. The moral character of girls bred in these schools, when married
women, was shown above. Their children, when opium does not give them the
finishing stroke, are born recruits of the gang. </p>

<p class="title">The gang in its classical form just described, is called the public, common,
or tramping gang. For there are also private gangs. These are made up in the
same way as the common gang, but count fewer members, and work, not under a
gang-master, but under some old farm servant, <!--651-->whom the farmer does
not know how to employ in any better way. The gipsy fun has vanished here, but
according to all witnesses, the payment and treatment of the children is worse.
<a name="113a" class="calibre14" id="113a"></a> <a name="114a" class="calibre14" id="114a"></a> <a name="115a" class="calibre14" id="115a"></a> <a name="116a" class="calibre14" id="116a"></a>
<a name="117a" class="calibre14" id="117a"></a> <a name="118a" class="calibre14" id="118a"></a></p>

<p class="title">The gang system, which during the last years has steadily increased, <sup class="enote"><a href="ch25_split_001.htm#n113" class="calibre1">[113]</a></sup> clearly does not exist for the
sake of the gang-master. it exists for the enrichment of the large farmers,
<sup class="enote"><a href="ch25_split_001.htm#n114" class="calibre1">[114]</a></sup> and indirectly of the
landlords. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch25_split_001.htm#n115" class="calibre1">[115]</a></sup> For the farmer
there is no more ingenious method of keeping his labourers well below the
normal level, and yet of always having an extra hand ready for extra work, of
extracting the greatest possible amount of labour with the least possible
amount of money <sup class="enote"><a href="ch25_split_001.htm#n116" class="calibre1">[116]</a></sup> and of
making adult male labour “redundant.” From the exposition already
made, it will be understood why, on the one hand, a greater or less lack of
employment for the agricultural labourer is admitted, while on the other, the
gang system is at the same time declared “necessary” on account of
the want of adult male labour and its migration to the towns. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch25_split_001.htm#n117" class="calibre1">[117]</a></sup> The cleanly weeded land, and the
uncleanly human weeds, of Lincolnshire, are pole and counterpole of
capitalistic production. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch25_split_001.htm#n118" class="calibre1">[118]</a></sup></p>

<h4 class="calibre15">F. Ireland</h4>

<p class="title">In concluding this section, we must travel for a moment to Ireland. First,
the main facts of the case. <a name="119a" class="calibre14" id="119a"></a></p>

<p class="title">The population of Ireland had, in 1841, reached 8,222,664; in 1851, it had
dwindled to 6,623,985; in 1861, to 5,850,309; in 1866, to 5½ millions, nearly
to its level in 1801. The diminution began with the famine year, 1846, so that
Ireland, in less than twenty years, lost more than 5/16 ths of its people. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch25_split_001.htm#n119" class="calibre1">[119]</a></sup> Its total emigration from May,
1851, to July, 1865, numbered 1,591,487: the emigration during the years
1861-1865 was more than half-a-million. The number of inhabited houses fell,
from 1851-1861, by 52,990. From 1851-1861, the number of holdings of 15 to 30
acres increased 61,000, that of holdings over 30 acres, 109,000, whilst the
total number of all farms fell 120,000, a fall, therefore, solely due to the
suppression of farms under 15 acres — <em class="calibre11">i.e</em>., to their
centralisation. </p>

    </tr></tbody></table><p class="title">England, a country with fully developed capitalist production, and
pre-eminently industrial, would have bled to death with such a drain of
population as Ireland has suffered. But Ireland is at present only an
agricultural district of England, marked off by a wide channel from the country
to which it yields corn, wool, cattle, industrial and military recruits. <a name="123a" class="calibre14" id="123a"></a> </p>

<p class="title">The depopulation of Ireland has thrown much of the land out of cultivation,
has greatly diminished the produce of the soil, <sup class="enote"><a href="ch25_split_001.htm#n123" class="calibre1">[123]</a></sup> and, in spite of the greater area devoted to
cattle breeding, has brought about, in some of its branches, an absolute
diminution, in others, an advance scarcely worthy of mention, and constantly
interrupted by retrogressions. Nevertheless, with the fall in numbers of the
population, rents and farmers’ profits rose, although the latter not as
steadily as the former. The reason of this is easily comprehensible. On the one
hand, with the throwing of small holdings into large ones, and the change of
arable into pasture land, a larger part of the whole produce was transformed
into surplus-produce. The surplus-produce increased, although the total
produce, of which it formed a fraction, decreased. On the other hand, the money
value of this surplus-produce increased yet more rapidly than its mass, in
consequence of the rise in the English market price of meat, wool, &amp;c.,
during the last 20, and especially during the last 10, years. </p>

<p class="title">The scattered means of production that serve the producers themselves as
means of employment and of subsistence, without expanding their own value by
the incorporation of the labour of others, are no more capital than a product
consumed by its own producer is a commodity. If, with the mass of the
population, that of the means of production employed in agriculture also
diminished, the mass of the capital employed in agriculture increased, because
a part of the means of production that were formerly scattered, was
concentrated and turned into capital. </p>

<p class="title">The total capital of Ireland outside agriculture, employed in industry and
trade, accumulated during the last two decades slowly, and with great and
constantly recurring fluctuations; so much the more rapidly did the
concentration of its individual constituents develop. And, however small its
absolute increase, in proportion to the dwindling population it had increased
largely. <a name="124a" class="calibre14" id="124a"></a></p>

<p class="title">Here, then, under our own eyes and on a large scale, a process is revealed,
than which nothing more excellent could be wished for by orthodox economy for
the support of its dogma: that misery springs from absolute surplus population,
and that equilibrium is re-established by depopulation. This is a far more
important experiment than was the plague in the middle of the 14th century so
belauded of Malthusians. Note further: If only the naïveté of the schoolmaster
could apply, to the conditions of production and population of the nineteenth
century, the standard of the 14th, this naïveté, into the bargain, overlooked
the fact that whilst, after the plague and the decimation that accompanied it,
followed on this side of the Channel, in England, enfranchisement and
enrichment of the agricultural population, on that side, in France, followed
greater servitude and more misery. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch25_split_001.htm#n124" class="calibre1">[124]</a></sup><a name="125a" class="calibre14" id="125a"></a></p>

<p class="title">The Irish famine of 1846 killed more than 1,000,000 people, but it killed
poor devils only. To the wealth of the country it did not the slightest damage.
The exodus of the next 20 years, an exodus still constantly increasing, did
not, as, <em class="calibre11">e.g.,</em> the Thirty Years’ War, decimate, along with the
human beings, their means of production. Irish genius discovered an altogether
new way of spiriting a poor people thousands of miles away from the scene of
its misery. The exiles transplanted to the United States, send home sums of
money every year as travelling expenses for those left behind. Every troop that
emigrates one year, draws another after it the next. Thus, instead of costing
Ireland anything, <!--659-->emigration forms one of the most lucrative branches
of its export trade. Finally, it is a systematic process, which does not simply
make a passing gap in the population, but sucks out of it every year more
people than are replaced by the births, so that the absolute level of the
population falls year by year. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch25_split_001.htm#n125" class="calibre1">[125]</a></sup></p>

<p class="title">What were the consequences for the Irish labourers left behind and freed
from the surplus population? That the relative surplus population is today as
great as before 1846; that wages are just as low, that the oppression of the
labourers has increased, that misery is forcing the country towards a new
crisis. <a name="126a" class="calibre14" id="126a"></a>The facts are simple. The revolution in agriculture
has kept pace with emigration. The production of relative surplus population
has more than kept pace with the absolute depopulation. A glance at table C.
shows that the change of arable to pasture land must work yet more acutely in
Ireland than in England. In England the cultivation of green crops increases
with the breeding of cattle; in Ireland, it decreases. Whilst a large number of
acres, that were formerly tilled, lie idle or are turned permanently into
grass-land, a great part of the waste land and peat bogs that were unused
formerly, become of service for the extension of cattle-breeding. The smaller
and medium farmers — I reckon among these all who do not cultivate more
than 100 acres — still make up about 8/10ths of the whole number. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch25_split_001.htm#n126" class="calibre1">[126]</a></sup> They are one after the other, and
with a degree of force unknown before, crushed by the competition of an
agriculture managed by capital, and therefore they continually furnish new
recruits to the class of wage labourers. The one great industry of Ireland,
linen-manufacture, requires relatively few adult men and only employs
altogether, in spite of its expansion since the price of cotton rose in
1861-1866, a comparatively insignificant part of the population. Like all other
great modern industries, it constantly produces, by incessant fluctuations, a
relative surplus population within its own sphere, even with an absolute
increase in the mass of human beings absorbed by it. The misery of the
agricultural population forms the pedestal for gigantic shirt-factories, whose
armies of labourers are, for the most part, scattered over the country. Here,
we encounter again the system described above of domestic industry, which in
underpayment and overwork, possesses its own systematic means for creating
supernumerary labourers. Finally, although the depopulation has not such
destructive consequences as would result in a country with fully developed
capitalistic production, it does not go on without constant <!--660-->reaction
upon the home-market. The gap which emigration causes here, limits not only the
local demand for labour, but also the incomes of small shopkeepers, artisans,
tradespeople generally. Hence the diminution in incomes between £60 and £100 in
Table E. <a name="127a" class="calibre14" id="127a"></a></p>

<p class="title">A clear statement of the condition of the agricultural labourers in Ireland
is to be found in the Reports of the Irish Poor Law Inspectors (1870). <sup class="enote"><a href="ch25_split_001.htm#n127" class="calibre1">[127]</a></sup> Officials of a government which
is maintained only by bayonets and by a state of siege, now open, now
disguised, they have to observe all the precautions of language that their
colleagues in England disdain. In spite of this, however, they do not let their
government cradle itself in illusions. According to them the rate of wages in
the country, still very low, has within the last 20 years risen 50-60 per
cent., and stands now, on the average, at 6s. to 9s. per week. But behind this
apparent rise, is hidden an actual fall in wages, for it does not correspond at
all to the rise in price of the necessary means of subsistence that has taken
place in the meantime. For proof, the following extract from the official
accounts of an Irish workhouse. </p>

    </tr></tbody></table><p class="title">The price of the necessary means of subsistence is therefore fully twice,
and that of clothing exactly twice, as much as they were 20 years before. <a name="128a" class="calibre14" id="128a"></a> </p>

<p class="title">Even apart from this disproportion, the mere comparison of the rate of wages
expressed in gold would give a result far from accurate. Before the famine, the
great mass of agricultural wages were paid in kind, only the smallest part in
money; today, payment in money is the rule. From this it follows that, whatever
the amount of the real wage, its money rate must rise.</p>

<p class="title">“Previous to the famine, the labourer enjoyed his cabin
 ... with a rood, or half-acre or acre of land, and facilities for ... a crop
of potatoes. He was able to rear his pig and keep fowl.... But they now have to
buy bread, and they have no refuse upon which they can feed a pig or fowl, and
they have consequently no benefit from the sale of a pig, fowl, or eggs.”
<sup class="enote"><a href="ch25_split_001.htm#n128" class="calibre1">[128]</a></sup></p>

<p class="title">In fact, formerly, the agricultural labourers were but the smallest of the
small farmers, and formed for the most part a kind of rear-guard of the medium
and large farms on which they found employment. Only since the catastrophe of
1846 have they begun to form a fraction of the class of purely wage labourers,
a special class, connected with its wage-masters only by monetary relations. <a name="129a" class="calibre14" id="129a"></a> <a name="130a" class="calibre14" id="130a"></a></p>

<p class="title">We know what were the conditions of their dwellings in 1846. Since then they
have grown yet worse. A part of the agricultural labourers, which, however,
grows less day by day, dwells still on the holdings of the farmers in
over-crowded huts, whose hideousness far surpasses the worst that the English
agricultural labourers offered us in this way. And this holds generally with
the exception of certain tracts of Ulster; in the south, in the counties of
Cork, Limerick, Kilkenny, &amp;c.; in the east, in Wicklow, Wexford, &amp;c.;
in the centre of Ireland, in King’s and Queen’s County,, Dublin,
&amp;c.; in the west, in Sligo, Roscommon, Mayo, Galway, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="title">“The agricultural labourers’ huts,” an
inspector cries out, “are a disgrace to the Christianity and to the
civilisation of this country.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch25_split_001.htm#n129" class="calibre1">[129]</a></sup></p>

<p class="title">In order to increase the attractions of these holes for the labourers, the
pieces of land belonging thereto from time immemorial, are systematically
confiscated.</p>

<p class="title">“The mere sense that they exist subject to this species
of ban, on the part of the landlords and their agents, has ... given birth in
the minds of the labourers to corresponding sentiments of antagonism and
dissatisfaction towards those by whom they are thus led to regard themselves as
being treated as ... a proscribed race.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch25_split_001.htm#n130" class="calibre1">[130]</a></sup><a name="131a" class="calibre14" id="131a"></a></p>

<p class="title">The first act of the agricultural revolution was to sweep away the huts
situated on the field of labour. This was done on the largest scale, and as if
in obedience to a command from on high. Thus many labourers were compelled to
seek shelter in villages and towns. There they were thrown like refuse into
garrets, holes, cellars and comers, in the worst back slums. Thousands of Irish
families, who according to the testimony of the English, eaten up as these are
with national prejudice, are notable for their rare attachment to the domestic
hearth, for their gaiety and the purity of their home-life, found themselves
suddenly transplanted into hotbeds of vice. The men are now obliged to seek
work of the neighbouring farmers and are only hired by the day, and therefore
under the most precarious form of wage. Hence</p>

<p class="title">“they sometimes have <!--662-->long distances to go to
and from work, often get wet, and suffer much hardship, not unfrequently ending
in sickness, disease and want.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch25_split_001.htm#n131" class="calibre1">[131]</a></sup><a name="132a" class="calibre14" id="132a"></a> <a name="133a" class="calibre14" id="133a"></a> <a name="134a" class="calibre14" id="134a"></a> <a name="135a" class="calibre14" id="135a"></a> <a name="136a" class="calibre14" id="136a"></a></p>

<p class="title">“ The towns have had to receive from year to year what
was deemed to be the surplus-labour of the rural division;” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch25_split_001.htm#n132" class="calibre1">[132]</a></sup> and then people still wonder
“there is still a surplus of labour in the towns and villages, and either
a scarcity or a threatened scarcity in some of the country divisions.”
<sup class="enote"><a href="ch25_split_001.htm#n133" class="calibre1">[133]</a></sup> The truth is that this want
only becomes perceptible “in harvest-time, or during spring, or at such
times as agricultural operations are carried on with activity; at other periods
of the year many hands are idle;” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch25_split_001.htm#n134" class="calibre1">[134]</a></sup> that “from the digging out of the main crop
of potatoes in October until the early spring following ... there is no
employment for them;” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch25_split_001.htm#n135" class="calibre1">[135]</a></sup>
and further, that during the active times they “are subject to broken
days and to all kinds of interruptions.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch25_split_001.htm#n136" class="calibre1">[136]</a></sup><a name="137a" class="calibre14" id="137a"></a></p>

<p class="title">These results of the agricultural revolution — <em class="calibre11">i.e.,</em> the

economy of labour, &amp;c., are still further aggravated by the model

<p class="title">“labour-supply ... chiefly from their small tenants,
who are obliged to attend when required to do the landlord’s work, at
rates of wages, in many instances, considerably under the current rates paid to
ordinary labourers, and without regard to the inconvenience or loss to the
tenant of being obliged to neglect his own business at critical periods of
sowing or reaping.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch25_split_001.htm#n137" class="calibre1">[137]</a></sup></p>

<p class="title">The uncertainty and irregularity of employment, the constant return and long
duration of gluts of labour, all these symptoms of a relative surplus
population, figure therefore in the reports of the Poor Law administration, as
so many hardships of the agricultural proletariat. It will be remembered that
we met, in the English agricultural proletariat, with a similar spectacle. But
the difference is that in England, an industrial country, the industrial
reserve recruits itself from the country districts, whilst in Ireland, an
agricultural country, the agricultural reserve recruits itself from the towns,
the cities of refuge of the expelled agricultural, labourers. In the former,
the supernumeraries of agriculture <!--663-->are transformed into factory
operatives; in the latter, those forced into the towns, whilst at the same time
they press on the wages in towns, remain agricultural labourers, and are
constantly sent back to the country districts in search of work. <a name="138a" class="calibre14" id="138a"></a></p>

<p class="title">The official inspectors sum up the material condition of the agricultural
labourer as follows:</p>

<p class="title">“Though living with the strictest frugality, his own
wages are barely sufficient to provide food for an ordinary family and pay his
rent” and he depends upon other sources for the means of clothing
himself, his wife, and children.... The atmosphere of these cabins, combined
with the. other privations they are subjected to, has made this class
particularly susceptible to low fever and pulmonary consumption.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch25_split_001.htm#n138" class="calibre1">[138]</a></sup></p>

<p class="title">After this, it is no wonder that, according to the unanimous testimony of
the inspectors, a sombre discontent runs through the ranks of this class, that
they long for the return of the past, loathe the present, despair of the
future, give themselves up “to the evil influence of agitators,”
and have only one fixed idea, to emigrate to America. This is the land of
Cockaigne, into which the great Malthusian panacea, depopulation, has
transformed green Erin. </p>

<p class="title">What a happy life the Irish factory operative leads one example will
show:</p>

<p class="title">“On my recent visit to the North of Ireland,”
says the English Factory Inspector, Robert Baker, “I met with the
following evidence of effort in an Irish skilled workman to afford education to
his children; and I give his evidence verbatim, as I took it from his mouth.
That he was a skilled factory hand, may be understood when I say that he was
employed on goods for the Manchester market. ‘Johnson. — I am a
beetler and work from 6 in the morning till 11 at night, from Monday to Friday.
Saturday we leave off at 6 p. m., and get three hours of it (for meals and
rest). I have five children in all. For this work I get 10s. 6d. a week,; my
wife works here also, and gets 5s. a week. The oldest girl who is 12, minds the
house. She is also cook, and all the servant we have. She gets the young ones
ready for school. A girl going past the house wakes me at half past five in the
morning. My wife gets up and goes along with me. We get nothing (to eat) before
we come to work. The child of 12 takes dare of the little children all the day,
and we get nothing till breakfast at eight. At eight we go home. <a name="139a" class="calibre14" id="139a"></a>We get tea once a week; at other times we get stirabout,
sometimes of oat-meal, sometimes of Indian meal, as we are able to get it. In
the winter we get a little sugar and water to our Indian meal. In the summer we
get a few potatoes, planting a small patch ourselves;. and when they are done
we get back to stirabout. Sometimes we get a little milk as it may be. So we go
on from day to day, Sunday and week day, always the same the year round. I am
always <!--664-->very much tired when I have done at night. We may see a bit of
flesh meat sometimes, but very seldom. Three of our children attend school, for
whom we pay 1d. a week a head. Our rent is 9d. a week. Peat for firing costs
1s. 6d. a fortnight at the very lowest.’” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch25_split_001.htm#n139" class="calibre1">[139]</a></sup></p>

<p class="title">Such are Irish wages, such is Irish life! </p>

<p class="title">In fact the misery of Ireland is again the topic of the day in England. At
the end of 1866 and the beginning of 1867, one of the Irish land magnates, Lord
Dufferin, set about its solution in <em class="calibre11">The Times.</em> “Wie menschlich
von solch grossem Herrn!” </p>

<p class="title">From Table E. we saw that, during 1864, of £4,368,610 of total profits,
three surplus-value makers pocketed only £262,819; that in 1865, however, out
of £4,669,979 total profits, the same three virtuosi of
“abstinence” pocketed £274,528; in 1864, 26 surplus-value makers
reached to £646,377; in 1865, 28 surplus-value makers reached to £736,448; in
1864, 121 surplus-value makers, £1,076,912; in 1865, 150 surplus-value makers,
£1,320,906; in 1864, 1,131 surplus-value makers £2,150,818, nearly half of the
total annual profit; in 1865, 1,194 surplus-value makers, £2,418,833, more than
half of the total annual profit. But the lion’s share, which an
inconceivably small number of land magnates in England, Scotland and Ireland
swallow up of the yearly national rental, is so monstrous that the wisdom of
the English State does not think fit to afford the same statistical materials
about the distribution of rents as about the distribution of profits. Lord
Dufferin is one of those land magnates. That rent-rolls and profits can ever be
“excessive,” or that their plethora is in any way connected with
plethora of the people’s misery is, of course, an idea as
“disreputable” as “unsound.” He keeps to facts. The
fact is that, as the Irish population diminishes, the Irish rent-rolls swell;
that depopulation benefits the landlords, therefore also benefits the soil,
and, therefore, the people, that mere accessory of the soil. He declares,
therefore, that Ireland is still over-populated, and the stream of emigration
still flows too lazily. To be perfectly happy, Ireland must get rid of at least
one-third of a million of labouring men. Let no man imagine that this lord,
poetic into the bargain, is a physician of the school of Sangrado, who as often
as he did not find his patient better, ordered phlebotomy and again phlebotomy,
until the patient lost his sickness at the same time as his blood. Lord
Dufferin demands a new blood-letting of one-third of a million only, instead of
about two millions; in fact, without the getting rid of. these, the millennium
in Erin is not to be. The proof is easily given.<a name="140a" class="calibre14" id="140a"></a> </p>

<p class="title">Centralisation has from 1851 to 1861 destroyed principally farms of the
first three categories, under 1 and not over 15 acres. These above all must
disappear. This gives 307,058 “supernumerary” farmers, and
reckoning the families the low average of 4 persons, 1,228,232 persons. On the
extravagant supposition that, after the agricultural revolution is complete
one-fourth of these are again absorbable, there remain for emigration 921,174
persons. Categories 4, 5, 6, of over 15 and not over 100 acres, are, as was
known long since in England, too small for capitalistic cultivation of corn,
and for sheep-breeding are almost vanishing quantities. On the same supposition
as before, therefore, there are further 788,761 persons to emigrate; total,
1,709,532. And as l’appétit vient en mangeant, Rentroll’s eyes will
soon discover that Ireland, with 3½ millions, is still always miserable, and
miserable because she is overpopulated. Therefore her depopulation must go yet
further, that thus she may fulfil her true destiny, that of an English
sheep-walk and cattle-pasture.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch25_split_001.htm#n141" class="calibre1">[141]</a></sup></p>

Karl Marx, l. c., “A égalité d’oppression des masses, plus un pays
a de prolétaires et plus il est riche.” (Colins, “L’Economie
Politique. Source des Révolutions et des Utopies, prétendues
Socialistes.” Paris, 1857, t. III., p. 331.) Our
“prolétarian” is economically none other than the wage labourer,
who produces and increases capital, and is thrown out on the streets, as soon
as he is superfluous for the needs of aggrandisement of “Monsieur
capital,” as Pecqueur calls this person. “The sickly proletarian of
the primitive forest,” is a pretty Roscherian fancy. The primitive
forester is owner of the primitive forest, and uses the primitive forest as his
property with the freedom of an orang-outang. He is not, therefore, a
proletarian. This would only be the case, if the primitive forest exploited
him, instead of being exploited by him. As far as his health is concerned, such
a man would well bear comparison, not only with the modern proletarian, but
also with the syphilitic and scrofulous upper classes. But, no doubt, Herr
Wilhelm Roscher, by “primitive forest” means his native heath of
Lüneburg.</p>

Eden should have asked, whose creatures then are “the civil
institutions"? From his standpoint of juridical illusion, he does not regard
the law as a product of the material relations of production, but conversely
the relations of production as products of the law. Linguet overthrew

If the reader reminds me of Malthus, whose “Essay on Population”
appeared in 1798, I remind him that this work in its first form is nothing more
than a schoolboyish, superficial plagiary of De Poe, Sir James Steuart,
Townsend, Franklin, Wallace, &amp;c., and does not contain a single sentence
thought out by himself. The great sensation this pamphlet caused, was due
solely to party interest. The French Revolution had found passionate defenders
in the United Kingdom; the “principle of population,” slowly worked
out in the eighteenth century, and then, in the midst of a great social crisis,
proclaimed with drums and trumpets as the infallible antidote to the teachings
of Condorcet, &amp;c., was greeted with jubilance by the English oligarchy as
the great destroyer of all hankerings after human development. Malthus, hugely
astonished at his success, gave himself to stuffing into his book materials
superficially compiled, and adding to it new matter, not discovered but annexed
by him. Note further: Although Malthus was a parson of the English State
Church, he had taken the monastic vow of celibacy — one of the conditions
of holding a Fellowship in Protestant Cambridge University: “Socios
collegiorum maritos esse non permittimus, sed statim postquam quis uxorem
duxerit socius collegii desinat esse.” (“Reports of Cambridge
University Commission,” p. 172.) This circumstance favourably
distinguishes Malthus from the other Protestant parsons, who have shuffled off
the command enjoining celibacy of the priesthood and have taken, “Be
fruitful and multiply,” as their special Biblical mission in such a
degree that they generally contribute to the increase of population to a really
unbecoming extent, whilst they preach at the same time to the labourers the
“principle of population.” It is characteristic that the economic
fall of man, the Adam’s apple, the urgent appetite, “the checks
which tend to blunt the shafts of Cupid,” as Parson Townsend waggishly
puts it, that this delicate question was and is monopolised by the Reverends of
Protestant Theology, or rather of the Protestant Church. With the exception of
the Venetian monk, Ortes, an original and clever writer, most of the population
theory teachers are Protestant parsons. For instance, Bruckner, “Théorie
du Système animal,” Leyde, 1767, in which the whole subject of the modern
population theory is exhausted, and to which the passing quarrel between
Quesnay and his pupil, the elder Mirabeau, fumished ideas on the same topic;
then Parson Wallace, Parson Townsend, Parson Malthus and his pupil, the
arch-Parson Thomas Chalmers, to say nothing of lesser reverend scribblers in
this line. Originally, Political Economy was studied by philosophers like
Hobbes, Locke, Hume; by businessmen and statesmen, like Thomas More, Temple,
Sully, De Witt, North, Law, Vanderlint, Cantillon, Franklin; and especially,
and with the greatest success, by medical men like Petty, Barbon, Mandeville,
Quesnay. Even in the middle of the eighteenth century, the Rev. Mr. Tucker, a
notable economist of his time, excused himself for meddling with the things of
Mammon. Later on, and in truth with this very “Principle of
population,” struck the hour of the Protestant parsons. Petty, who
regarded the population as the basis of wealth, and was, like Adam Smith, an
outspoken foe to parsons, says, as if he had a presentiment of their bungling
interference, “that Religion best flourishes when the Priests are most
mortified, as was before said of the Law, which best flourisheth when lawyers
have least to do.” He advises the Protestant priests, therefore, if they,
once for all, will not follow the Apostle Paul and “mortify”
themselves by celibacy, “not to breed more Churchmen than the Benefices,
as they now stand shared out, will receive, that is to say, if there be places
for about twelve thousand in England and Wales, it will not be safe to breed up
24,000 ministers, for then the twelve thousand which are unprovided for, will
seek ways how to get themselves a livelihood, which they cannot do more easily
than by persuading the people that the twelve thousand incumbents do poison or
starve their souls, and misguide them in their way to Heaven.” (Petty:
“A Treatise of Taxes and Contributions,” London, 1667, p. 57.) Adam
Smith’s position with the Protestant priesthood of his time is shown by
the following. In “A Letter to A. Smith, L.L.D. On the Life, Death, and
Philosophy of his Friend, David Hume. By one of the People called
Christians,” 4th Edition, Oxford, 1784, Dr. Horne, Bishop of Norwich,
reproves Adam Smith, because in a published letter to Mr. Strahan, he
“embalmed his friend David” (sc. Hume); because he told the world
how “Hume amused himself on his deathbed with Lucian and Whist,”
and because he even had the impudence to write of Hume: “I have always
considered him, both in his life-time and since his death, as approaching as
nearly to the idea of a perfectly wise and virtuous man, as, perhaps, the
nature of human frailty will permit.” The bishop cries out, in a passion:
“Is it right in you, Sir, to hold up to our view as ‘perfectly wise
and virtuous,’ <em class="calibre11">the character and conduct</em> of one, who seems to
have been possessed with an incurable antipathy to all that is called
<em class="calibre11">Religion;</em> and who strained every nerve to explode, suppress and
extirpate the spirit of it among men, that its very name, if he could effect
it, might no more be had in remembrance?” (l. c., p. 8.) “But let
not the lovers of truth be discouraged. Atheism cannot be of long
continuance.” (P. 17.) Adam Smith, “had the atrocious wickedness to
propagate atheism through the land (viz., by his “Theory of Moral
Sentiments”). Upon the whole, Doctor, your meaning is good; but I think
you will not succeed this time. You would persuade us, by the example of
<em class="calibre11">David Hume, Esq.,</em> that atheism is the only cordial for low spirits,
and the proper antidote against the fear of death.... You may smile over
<em class="calibre11">Babylon</em> in ruins and congratulate the hardened <em class="calibre11">Pharaoh</em> on his
overthrow in the Red Sea.” (l. c., pp. 21, 22.) One orthodox individual,
amongst Adam Smith’s college friends, writes after his death:
“Smith’s well-placed affection for Hume ... hindered him from being
a Christian.... When he met with honest men whom he liked ... he would believe
almost anything they said. Had he been a friend of the worthy ingenious Horrox
he would have believed that the moon some times disappeared in a clear sky
without the interposition of a cloud.... He approached to republicanism in his
political principles.” (“The Bee.” By James Anderson, 18
Vols., Vol. 3, pp. 166, 165, Edinburgh, 1791-93.) Parson Thomas Chalmers has
his suspicions as to Adam Smith having invented the category of
“unproductive labourers,” solely for the Protestant parsons, in
spite of their blessed work in the vineyard of the Lord.</p>

“The limit, however, to the employment of both the operative and the
labourer is the same; namely, the possibility of the employer realising a
<em class="calibre11">profit</em> on the produce of their industry. If the rate of wages is such
as to reduce the master’s gains below the average profit of capital, he
will cease to employ them, or he will only employ them on condition of
submission to a reduction of wages.” (John Wade, l. c., p. 241.)</p>

it seems quite incomprehensible that man can have fallen under the domination

labourer been able to pass from being master of capital — as its creator
— to being its slave?” (Von Thünen, “Der isolierte

The law of progressive diminution of the relative magnitude of variable capital
and its effect on the condition of the class of wage workers is conjectured
rather than understood by some of the prominent economists of the classical
school. The greatest service was rendered here by John Barton, although he,
like all the rest, lumps together constant and fixed capital, variable and
circulating capital. He says: </p>

<p class="information1">“The demand for labour
depends on the increase of circulating, and not of fixed capital. Were it true
that the proportion between these two sorts of capital is the same at all
times, and in all circumstances, then, indeed, it follows that the number of
labourers employed is in proportion to the wealth of the state. But such a
proposition has not the semblance of probability. As arts are cultivated, and
civilisation is extended, fixed capital bears a larger and larger proportion to
circulating capital. The amount of fixed capital employed in the production of
a piece of British muslin is at least a hundred, probably a thousand times
greater than that employed in a similar piece of Indian muslin. And the
proportion of circulating capital is a hundred or thousand times less ... the
whole of the annual savings, added to the fixed capital, would have no effect
in increasing the demand for labour.” (John Barton, “Observations
on the Circumstances which Influence the Condition of the Labouring Classes of
Society.” London, 1817, pp. 16, 17.) “The same cause which may
increase the net revenue of the country may at the same time render the
population redundant, and deteriorate the condition of the labourer.”
(Ricardo, l. c., p. 469.) With increase of capital, “the demand [for
labour] will be in a diminishing ratio.” (Ibid., p. 480, Note.)
“The amount of capital devoted to the maintenance of labour may vary,
independently of any changes in the whole amount of capital.... Great
fluctuations in the amount of employment, and great suffering may become more
frequent as capital itself becomes more plentiful.” (Richard Jones,
“An Introductory Lecture on Pol. Econ.,” Lond. 1833, p. 13)
“Demand [for labour] will rise ... not in proportion to the accumulation
of the general capital. ... Every augmentation, therefore, in the national
stock destined for reproduction, comes, in the progress of society, to have
less and less influence upon the condition of the labourer.” (Ramsay, l.
c., pp. 90, 91.)</p>

<p class="title"><span><a name="n19" href="ch25_split_000.htm#19a" class="calibre1" id="n19">19.</a></span> Even in the cotton famine of 1863 we find, in a
pamphlet of the operative cotton-spinners of Blackburn, fierce denunciations of
overwork, which, in consequence of the Factory Acts, of course only affected
adult male labourers. “The adult operatives at this mill have been asked
to work from 12 to 13 hours per day, while there are hundreds who are compelled
to be idle who would willingly work partial time, in order to maintain their
families and save their brethren from a premature grave through being
overworked.... We,” it goes on to say, “would ask if the practice
of working overtime by a number of hands, is likely to create a good feeling
between masters and servants. Those who are worked overtime feel the injustice
equally with those who are condemned to forced idleness. There is in the
district almost sufficient work to give to all partial employment if fairly
distributed. We are only asking what is right in requesting the masters
generally to pursue a system of short hours, particularly until a better state
of things begins to dawn upon us, rather than to work a portion of the hands
overtime, while others, for want of work, are compelled to exist upon
charity.” (“Reports of Insp. of Fact., Oct. 31, 1863,” p. 8.)
The author of the “Essay on Trade and Commerce” grasps the effect
of a relative surplus population on the employed labourers with his usual
unerring bourgeois instinct. “Another cause of idleness in this kingdom
is the want of a sufficient number of labouring hands .... Whenever from an
extraordinary demand for manufactures, labour grows scarce, the labourers feel
their own consequence, and will make their masters feel it likewise — it
is amazing; but so depraved are the dispositions of these people, that in such
cases a set of workmen have combined to distress the employer by idling a whole
day together.” (“Essay, &amp;c.,” pp. 27, 28.) The fellows in
fact were hankering after a rise in wages.</p>

working people in London were thrown out of work, the Factory Report for that
same half year says: “It does not appear absolutely true to say that
demand will always produce supply just at the moment when it is needed. It has
not done so with labour, for much machinery has been idle last year for want of
hands.” (“Rep. of Insp. of Fact., 31st Oct., 1866,” p.
81.)</p>

and Wales “contained 10,960,998 inhabitants, while the villages and
country parishes contained 9,105,226. In 1851, 580 towns were distinguished,
and the population in them and in the surrounding country was nearly equal. But
while in the subsequent ten years the population in the villages and the
country increased half a million, the population in the 580 towns increased by
a million and a half (1,554,067). The increase of the population of the country
parishes is 6.5 per cent., and of the towns 17.3 per cent. The difference in
the rates of increase is due to the migration from country to town.
Three-fourths of the total increase of population has taken place in the
towns.” (“Census. &amp;c.,” pp. 11 and 12.)</p>

generation.” (A. Smith.) This is even a specially wise arrangement of
God, according to the gallant and witty Abbé Galiani “Iddio af che gli
uomini che esercitano mestieri di prima utiliti nascono abbondantemente.”
(Galiani, l. c., p. 78.) <span>[God ordains that men who carry
on trades of primary utility are born in abundance]</span> “Misery up to
the extreme point of famine and pestilence, instead of checking, tends to
increase population.” (S. Laing, “National Distress,” 1844,
p. 69.) After Laing has illustrated this by statistics, he continues: “If
the people were all in easy circumstances, the world would soon be
depopulated.” </p>

que les rapports de production dans lesquels se meut la bourgeoisie n’ont
pas un caractère un, un catactère simple, mais un caractère de duplicité; que
dans les mêmes rapports dans lesquels se produit la richesse, la misére se
produit aussi; que dans les mêmes rapports dans lesquels il y a développement
des forces productives, il y a une force productive de répression; que ces
rapports ne produisent la richesse bourgeoise, c’est-à-dire la richesse
de la classe bourgeoise, qu’en anéantissant continuellement la richesse
des membres intégrants de cette classe et en produisant un prolétariat toujours
croissant.” <span>[From day to day it thus becomes
clearer that the production relations in which the bourgeoisie moves have not a
simple, uniform character, but a dual character; that in the selfsame relations
in which wealth is produced, poverty is produced also; that in the selfsame
relations in which there is a development of productive forces, there is also a
force producing repression; that there relations produce bourgeois wealth,
i.e., the wealth of the bourgeois class, only by continually annihilating the
wealth of the individual members of this class and by producing an evergrowing
proletariat]</span> (Karl Marx: “Misère de la Philosophie,” p.
116.)</p>

1817, pp. 15, 39, 41. This “delicate” parson, from whose work just
quoted, as well as from his “Journey through Spain,” Malthus often
copies whole pages, himself borrowed the greater part of his doctrine from Sir
James Steuart, whom he however alters in the borrowing. <em class="calibre11">E.g</em>., when
Steuart says: “Here, in slavery, was a forcible method of making mankind
diligent,” [for the non-workers] ... “Men were then forced to
work” [<em class="calibre11">i.e</em>.,to work gratis for others], “because they were
slaves of others; men are now forced to work” [<em class="calibre11">i.e</em>., to work
gratis for non-workers] “because they are the slaves of their
necessities,” he does not thence conclude, like the fat holder of
benefices, that the wage labourer must always go fasting. He wishes, on the
contrary, to increase their wants and to make the increasing number of their
wants a stimulus to their labour for the “more delicate.” </p>

classes, are repeated in each of their reports. So <em class="calibre11">e.g.,</em> “A

features in the social state of this country that we see, beyond the
possibility of denial, that while there is at this moment a decrease in the
consuming powers of the people, an increase of the pressure of privations and
distress; there is at the same time a constant accumulation of wealth in the
upper classes, an increase of the luxuriousness of their habits, and of their
means of enjoyment.” (Hansard, 13th Feb.)</p>

not the slightest means of ventilation except up a hole pulled through the top,

Within the last few days the walls of London have been placarded with large

especially in the census category: “Farmer’s son, grandson,
brother, nephew, daughter, granddaughter, sister, niece"; in a word, the
members of his own family, employed by the farmer. This category numbered, in
1851, 216,851 persons; in 1861, only 176,151. From 1851 to 1871, the farms
under 20 acres fell by more than 900 in number; those between 50 and 75 acres
fell from 8,253 to 6,370; the same thing occurred with all other farms under
100 acres. On the other hand, during the same twenty years, the number of large
farms increased; those of 300-500 acres rose from 7,771 to 8,410, those of more

receives only 1/4 as much milk, and ½ as much bread as the Irish. Arthur Young
in his “Tour in Ireland,” at the beginning of this century, already
noticed the better nourishment of the latter. The reason is simply this, that
the poor Irish farmer is incomparably more humane than the rich English. As
regards Wales, that which is said in the text holds only for the southwest. All
the doctors there agree that the increase of the death-rate through
tuberculosis, scrofula, etc., increases in intensity with the deterioration of
the physical condition of the population, and all ascribe this deterioration to
poverty. “His (the farm labourer’s) keep is reckoned at about five
pence a day, but in many districts it was said to be of much less cost to the
farmer” [himself very poor].... “A morsel of the salt meat or
bacon, ... salted and dried to the texture of mahogany, and hardly worth the
difficult process of assimilation ... is used to flavour a large quantity of
broth or gruel, of meal and leeks, and day after day this is the
labourer’s dinner.” The advance of industry resulted for him, in
this harsh and damp climate, in “the abandonment of the solid homespun
clothing in favour of the cheap and so-called cotton goods,” and of
stronger drinks for so-called tea. “The agriculturist, after several
hours’ exposure to wind and rain, pins his cottage to sit by a fire of
peat or of balls of clay and small coal kneaded together, from which volumes of
carbonic and sulphurous acids are poured forth. His walls are of mud and
stones, his floor the bare earth which was there before the hut was built, his
roof a mass of loose and sodden thatch. Every crevice is topped to maintain
warmth, and in an atmosphere of diabolic odour, with a mud fioor, with his only
clothes drying on his back, he often sups and sleeps with his wife and
children. Obstetricians who have passed parts of the night in such cabins have
described how they found their feet sinking in the mud of the floor, and they
were forced (easy task) to drill a hole through the wall to effect a little
private respiration. It was attested by numerous witnesses in various grades of
life, that to these insanitary influences, and many more, the underfed peasant
was nightly exposed, and of the result, a debilitated and scrofulous people,
there was no want of evidence.... The statements of the relieving officers of
Carmarthenshire and Cardiganshire show in a striking way the same state of
things. There is besides “a plague more horrible still, the great number
of idiots.” Now a word on the climatic conditions. “A strong
south-west wind blows over the whole country for 8 or 9 months in the year,
bringing with it torrents of rain, which discharge principally upon the western
slopes of the hills. Trees are rare, except in sheltered places, and where not
protected, are blown out of all shape. The cottages generally crouch under some
bank, or often in a ravine or quarry, and none but the smallest sheep and
native cattle can live on the pastures.... The young people migrate to the
eastern mining districts of Glamorgan and Monmouth. Carmarthenshire is the
breeding ground of the mining population and their hospital. The population can
therefore barely maintain its numbers.” Thus in Cardiganshire:</p>

<p class="title"><span><a name="n100" href="ch25_split_000.htm#100a" class="calibre1" id="n100">100.</a></span> In 1865 this law was improved to some extent. It
will soon be learnt from experience that tinkering of this sort is of no
use.</p>

<p class="title"><span><a name="n101" href="ch25_split_000.htm#101a" class="calibre1" id="n101">101.</a></span> In order to understand that which follows, we must
remember that “Close Villages” are those whose owners are one or
two large landlords. “Open villages,” those whose soil belongs to
many smaller landlords. It is in the latter that building speculators can build
cottages and lodging-houses.</p>

<p class="title"><span><a name="n102" href="ch25_split_000.htm#102a" class="calibre1" id="n102">102.</a></span> A show-village of this kind looks very nice, but
is as unreal as the villages that Catherine II. saw on her journey to the
Crimea. In recent times the shepherd, also has often been banished from these
show-villages; <em class="calibre11">e.g</em>., near Market Harboro is sheep-farm of about 500
acres, which only employs the labour of one man. To reduce the long trudges
over these wide plains, the beautiful pastures of Leicester and Northampton,
the shepherd used to get a cottage on the farm. Now they give him a thirteenth
shilling a week for lodging, that he must find far away in an open village.</p>

<p class="title"><span><a name="n103" href="ch25_split_000.htm#103a" class="calibre1" id="n103">103.</a></span> “The labourers’ houses (in the open
villages, which, of course, are always overcrowded) are usually in rows, built
with their backs against the extreme edge of the plot of land which the builder
could call his, and on this account are not allowed light and air, except from
the front.” (Dr. Hunter’s Report, l. c., p. 135.) Very often the
beerseller or grocer of the village is at the same time the letter of its
houses. In this case the agricultural labourer finds in him a second master,
besides the farmer. He must be his customer as well as his tenant. “The
hind with his 10s. a week, minus a rent of £4 a year ... is obliged to buy at
the seller’s own terms, his modicum of tea, sugar, flour, soap, candies,
and beer.” (l. c., p. 132.) These open villages form, in fact, the
“penal settlements” of the English agricultural proletariat. Many
of the cottages are simply lodging-houses, through which all the rabble of the
neighbourhood passes. The country labourer and his family who had often, in a
way truly wonderful, preserved, under the foulest conditions, a thoroughness
and purity of character, go, in these, utterly to the devil. It is, of course,
the fashion amongst the aristocratic shylocks to shrug their shoulders
pharisaically at the building speculators, the small landlords, and the open
villages. They know well enough that their “close villages” and
“show-villages” are the birth-places of the open villages, and
could not exist without them. “The labourers ... were it not for the
small owners, would, for by far the most part, have to sleep under the trees of
the farms on which they work.” (l. c., p. 135.) The system of
“open” and “closed” villages obtains in all the Midland
counties and throughout the East of England.</p>

<p class="title"><span><a name="n104" href="ch25_split_000.htm#104a" class="calibre1" id="n104">104.</a></span> “The employer ... is ... directly or
indirectly securing to himself the profit on a man employed at 10s. a week, and
receiving from this poor hind £4 or £5 annual rent for houses not worth £20 in
a really free market, but maintained at their artificial value by the power of
the owner to say ‘Use my house, or go seek a hiring elsewhere without a
character from me....’ Does a man wish to better himself, to go as a
plate-layer on the railway, or to begin quarry-work, the same power is ready
with ‘Work for me at this low rate of wages or begone at a week’s
notice; take your pig with you, and get what you can for the potatoes growing
in your garden.’ Should his interest appear to be better served by it, an
enhanced rent is sometimes preferred in these cases by the owner
(<em class="calibre11">i.e</em>., the farmer) as the penalty for leaving his service.” (Dr.
Hunter, l. c., p. 132.)</p>

<p class="title"><span><a name="n105" href="ch25_split_000.htm#105a" class="calibre1" id="n105">105.</a></span> “New married couples are no edifying study
for grown-up brothers and sisters: and though instances must not be recorded,
sufficient data are remembered to warrant the remark, that great depression and
sometimes death are the lot of the female participator in the offence of
incest.” (Dr. Hunter, l. c., p. 137.) A member of the rural police who
had for many years been a detective in the worst quarters of London, says of
the girls of his village: “their boldness and shamelessness I never saw
equalled during some years of police life and detective duty in the worst parts
of London .... They live like pigs, great boys and girls, mothers and fathers,
all sleeping in one room, in many instances.” (“Child. Empl. Com.
Sixth Report, 1867,” p. 77 sq. 155.)</p>

<p class="title"><span><a name="n107" href="ch25_split_001.htm#107a" class="calibre1" id="n107">107.</a></span> “The heaven-born employment of the hind
gives dignity even to his position. He is not a slave, but a soldier of peace,
and deserves his place in married men’s quarters to be provided by the
landlord, who has claimed a power of enforced labour similar to that the
country demands of the soldier. He no more receives market-price for his work
than does the soldier. Like the soldier he is caught young, ignorant, knowing
only his own trade, and his own locality. Early marriage and. the operation of
the various laws of settlement affect the one as enlistment and the Mutiny Act
affect the other.” (Dr. Hunter, l. c., p. 132.) Sometimes an
exceptionally soft-hearted landlord relents as the solitude he has created.
“It is a melancholy thing to stand alone in one’s country,”
said Lord Leicester, when complimented on the completion of Hookham. “I
look around and not a house is to be seen but mine. I am the giant of Giant
Castle, and have eat up all my neighbours.” </p>

<p class="title"><span><a name="n108" href="ch25_split_001.htm#108a" class="calibre1" id="n108">108.</a></span> A similar movement is seen during the last ten
years in France; in proportion as capitalist production there takes possession
of agriculture, it drives the “surplus” agricultural population
into the towns. Here also we find deterioration in the housing and other
conditions at the source of the surplus population. On the special
“prolétariat foncier,” to which this system of parcelling out the
land has given rise, see, among others, the work of Colins, already quoted, and
Karl Marx “Der Achtzehnte Brumaire des Louis Bonaparte.” 2nd
edition. Hamburg, 1869, pp. 56, &amp;c. In 1846, the town population in France
was represented by 24.42, the agricultural by 75.58; in 1861, the town by
28.86, the agricultural by 71.14 per cent. During the last 5 years, the
diminution of the agricultural percentage of the population has been yet more
marked. As early as 1846, Pierre Dupont in his “Ouvriers” sang: </p>

Children’s Employment Commission,” published at the end of March,
1867. It deals solely with the agricultural gang-system.</p>

<p class="title"><span><a name="n111" href="ch25_split_001.htm#111a" class="calibre1" id="n111">111.</a></span> Some gang-masters, however, have worked themselves
up to the position of farmers of 500 acres, or proprietors of whole rows of
houses.</p>

<p class="title"><span><a name="n112" href="ch25_split_001.htm#112a" class="calibre1" id="n112">112.</a></span> “Half the girls of Ludford have been ruined
by going out” (in gangs). l. c., p. 6, § 32.</p>

<p class="title"><span><a name="n113" href="ch25_split_001.htm#113a" class="calibre1" id="n113">113.</a></span> “They (gangs) have greatly increased of late
years. In some places they are said to have been introduced at comparatively
late dates; in others where gangs ... have been known for many years ... more
and younger children are employed in them.” (l. c., p. 79, § 174).</p>

<p class="title"><span><a name="n114" href="ch25_split_001.htm#114a" class="calibre1" id="n114">114.</a></span> “Small farmers never employ gangs.”
“It is not on poor land, but on land which affords rent of from 40 to 50
shillings, that women and children are employed in the greatest numbers.”
(l. c., pp. 17, 14.)</p>

<p class="title"><span><a name="n115" href="ch25_split_001.htm#115a" class="calibre1" id="n115">115.</a></span> To one of these gentlemen the taste of his rent
was so grateful that he indignantly declared to the Commission of Inquiry that
the whole hubbub was only due to the name of the system. If instead of
“gang” it were called “the Agricultural Juvenile Industrial
Self-supporting Association,” everything would be all right.</p>

<p class="title"><span><a name="n116" href="ch25_split_001.htm#116a" class="calibre1" id="n116">116.</a></span> “Gang work is cheaper than other work; that
is why they are employed,” says a former gang-master (l. c., p. 17, § 14
)."The gang-system is decidedly the cheapest for the farmer, and decidedly the
worst for the children,” says a farmer (l. c., p. 16, § 3.)</p>

<p class="title"><span><a name="n117" href="ch25_split_001.htm#117a" class="calibre1" id="n117">117.</a></span> “Undoubtedly much of the work now done by
children in gangs used to be done by men and women. More men are out of work
now where children and women are employed than formerly.” (l. c., p. 43,
n. 202.) On the other hand, “the labour question in some agricultural
districts, particularly the arable, is becoming so serious in consequence of
emigration, and the facility afforded by railways for getting to large towns
that I (the “I” is the steward of a great lord) think the services
of children are most indispensable,” (l. c., p. 80, n. 180.) For the
“labour question” in English agricultural districts, differently
from the rest of the civilised world, means the landlords’ and
farmers’ question, <em class="calibre11">viz</em>., how is it possible, despite an always
increasing exodus of the agricultural folk, to keep up a sufficient relative
surplus population in the country, and by means of it keep the wages of the
agricultural labourer at a minimum?</p>

<p class="title"><span><a name="n118" href="ch25_split_001.htm#118a" class="calibre1" id="n118">118.</a></span> The “Public Health Report,” where in
dealing with the subject of children’s mortality, the gang-system is
treated in passing, remains unknown to the press, and, therefore, to the
English public. On the other hand, the last report of the “Child. Empl.
Comm.” afforded the press sensational copy always welcome. Whilst the
Liberal press asked how the fine gentlemen and ladies, and the well-paid clergy
of the State Church, with whom Lincolnshire swarms, could allow such a system
to arise on their estates, under their very eyes, they who send out expressly
missions to the Antipodes, “for the improvement of the morals of South
Sea Islanders” — the more refined press confined itself to
reflections on the coarse degradation of the agricultural population who are
capable of selling their children into such slavery! Under the accursed
conditions to which these “delicate” people condemn the
agricultural labourer, it would not be surprising if he ate his own children.
What is really wonderful is the healthy integrity of character, he has, in
great part, retained. The official reports prove that the parents, even in the
gang districts, loathe the gang-system. “There is much in the evidence
that shows that the parents of the children would, in many instances, be glad
to be aided by the requirements of a legal obligation, to resist the pressure
and the temptations to which they are often subject. They are liable to be
urged, at times by the parish officers, at times by employers, under threats of
being themselvat discharged, to be taken to work at an age when ... school
attendance ... would be manifestly to their greater advantage.... All that time
and strength wasted; all the suffering from extra and unprofitable fatigue
produced to the labourer and to his children; every instance in which the
parent may have traced the moral ruin of his child to fhe undermining of
delicacy by the over-crowding of cottages, or to the contaminating influences
of the public gang, must have been so many incentives to feelings in the minds
of the labouring poor which can be well understood, and which it would be
needless to particularise. They must be conscious that much bodily and mental
pain has thus been inflicted upon them from causes for which they were in no
way answerable; to which, had it been in their power, they would have in no way
consented; and against which they were powerless to struggle.” (l. c., p.
xx., § 82, and xxiii., n. 96.)</p>

<p class="title"><span><a name="n119" href="ch25_split_001.htm#119a" class="calibre1" id="n119">119.</a></span> Population of Ireland, 1801, 5,319,867 persons;
1811, 6,084,996; 1821, 6,869,544; 1831, 7,828,347; 1841, 8,222,664.</p>

<p class="title"><span><a name="n120" href="ch25_split_001.htm#120a" class="calibre1" id="n120">120.</a></span> The result would be found yet more unfavourable if
we went further back. Thus: Sheep in 1865, 3,688,742, but in 1856, 3,694,294.
Pigs in 1865, 1,299,893, but in 1858, 1,409,883.</p>

<p class="title"><span><a name="n121" href="ch25_split_001.htm#121a" class="calibre1" id="n121">121.</a></span> The data of the text are put together from the
materials of the “Agricultural Statistics, Ireland, General Abstracts,
Dublin,” for the years 1860, <em class="calibre11">el seq.,</em> and “Agricultural
Statistics, Ireland. Tables showing the estimated average produce, &amp;c.,
Dublin, 1866.” These statistics are official, and laid before Parliament
annually. </p>

<p class="title"><em class="calibre11">Note to 2nd edition</em>. The official statistics
for the year 1872 show, as compared with 1871, a decrease in area under
cultivation of 134,915 acres. An increase occurred in the cultivation of green
crops, turnips, mangold-wurzel, and the like; a decrease in the area under
cultivation for wheat of 16,000 acres; oats, 14,000; barley and rye, 4,000;
potatoes, 66,632; flax, 34,667; grass, clover, vetches, rape-seed, 30,000. The
soil under cultivation for wheat shows for the last 5 years the following
stages of decrease: — 1868, 285,000 acres; 1869, 280,000; 1870, 259,000;
1871, 244,000; 1872, 228,000. For 1872 we find, in round numbers, an increase
of 2,600 horses, 80,000 horned cattle, 68,609 sheep, and a decrease of 236,000
pigs.</p>

<p class="title"><span><a name="n122" href="ch25_split_001.htm#122a" class="calibre1" id="n122">122.</a></span> The total yearly income under Schedule D. is
different in this table from that which appears in the preceding ones, because
of certain deductions allowed by law.</p>

<p class="title"><span><a name="n123" href="ch25_split_001.htm#123a" class="calibre1" id="n123">123.</a></span> If the product also diminishes relatively per
acre, it must not be forgotten that for a century and a half England has
indirectly exported the soil of Ireland, without as much as allowing its
cultivators the means for making up the constituents of the soil that had been
exhausted.</p>

<p class="title"><span><a name="n124" href="ch25_split_001.htm#124a" class="calibre1" id="n124">124.</a></span> As Ireland is regarded as the promised land of the
“principle of population,” Th. Sadler, before the publication of
his work on population, issued his famous book, “Ireland, its Evils and
their Remedies.” 2nd edition, London, 1829. Here, by comparison of the
statistics of the individual provinces, and of the individual counties in each
province, he proves that the misery there is not, as Malthus would have it, in
proportion to the number of the population, but in inverse ratio to this.</p>

<p class="title"><span><a name="n125" href="ch25_split_001.htm#125a" class="calibre1" id="n125">125.</a></span> Between 1851 and 1874, the total number of
emigrants amounted to 2,325,922.</p>

<p class="title"><span><a name="n126" href="ch25_split_001.htm#126a" class="calibre1" id="n126">126.</a></span> According to a table in Murphy’s
“Ireland Industrial, Political and Social,” 1870, 94.6 per cent. or
the holdings do not reach 100 acres, 5.4 exceed 100 acres.</p>

deliberately made the most of, both by the individual landlords and by the
English legislature, to forcibly carry out the agricultural revolution and to
thin the population of Ireland down to the proportion satisfactory to the
landlords, I shall show more fully in Vol. III. of this work, in the section on
landed property. There also I return to the condition of the small farmers and
the agricultural labourers. At present, only one quotation. Nassau W. Senior
says, with other things, in his posthumous work, “Journals, Conversations
and Essays relating to Ireland.” 2 vols. London, 1868; Vol. II., p. 282.
“Well,” said Dr. G., “we have got our Poor Law and it is a
great instrument for giving the victory to the landlords. Another, and a still
more powerful instrument is emigration.... No friend to Ireland can wish the
war to be prolonged [between the landlords and the small Celtic farmers]
— still less, that it should end by the victory of the tenants. The
sooner it is over — the sooner Ireland becomes a grazing country, with
the comparatively thin population which a grazing country requires, the better
for all classes.” The English Corn Laws of 1815 secured Ireland the
monopoly of the free importation of corn into Great Britain. They favoured
artificially, therefore, the cultivation of corn. With the abolition of the
Corn Laws in 1846, this monopoly was suddenly removed. Apart from all other
circumstances, this event alone was sufficient to give a great impulse to the
turning of Irish arable into pasture land, to the concentration of arms, and to
the eviction of small cultivators. After the fruitfulness of the Irish soil had
been praised from 1815 to 1846, and proclaimed loudly as by Nature herself
destined for the cultivation of wheat, English agronomists, economists,
politicians, discover suddenly that it is good for nothing but to produce
forage. M. Léonce de Lavergne has hastened to repeat this on the other side of
the Channel. It takes a “serious” man, à la Lavergne, to be caught
by such childishness. </p>
