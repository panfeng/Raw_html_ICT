<hr class="end1"/><a name="a146" class="calibre14" id="a146"></a>
<p class="title">All political economists of any standing admit that
the introduction of new machinery has a baneful effect on the workmen in
the old handicrafts and manufactures with which this machinery at first
competes. Almost all of them bemoan the slavery of the factory operative.
And what is the great trump-card that they play? That machinery, after
the horrors of the period of introduction and development have subsided,
instead of diminishing, in the long run increases the number of the slaves
of labour! Yes, Political Economy revels in the hideous theory, hideous
to every “philanthropist” who believes in the eternal Nature-ordained necessity
for capitalist production, that after a period of growth and transition,
even its crowning success, the factory system based on machinery, grinds
down more workpeople than on its first introduction it throws on the streets.
<sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n146" class="calibre1">[146]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title">It is true that in some cases, as we saw from instances of English
worsted and silk factories, an extraordinary extension of the factory system
may, at a certain stage of its development, be accompanied not <!--422-->only
by a relative, but by an absolute decrease in the number of operatives
employed. In the year 1860, when a special census of all the factories
in the United Kingdom was taken by order of Parliament, the factories in
those parts of Lancashire, Cheshire, and Yorkshire, included in the district
of Mr. Baker, the factory inspector, numbered 652; 570 of these contained
85,622 power-looms, 6,819,146 spindles (exclusive of doubling spindles),
employed 27,439 horse-power (steam), <a name="a147" class="calibre14" id="a147"></a><a name="a148" class="calibre14" id="a148"></a>and 1,390 (water), and 94,119 persons. In the year 1865, the same factories contained, looms 95,163, spindles
7,025,031, had a steam-power of 28,925 horses, and a water-power of 1,445
horses, and employed 88,913 persons. Between 1860 and 1865, therefore,
the increase in looms was 11%, in spindles 3%, and in engine-power 3%,
while the number of persons employed decreased 5½%. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n147" class="calibre1">[147]</a></sup> Between 1852 and 1862, considerable extension of the English woollen manufacture took place, while the number of hands employed in it remained almost stationary, <a name="a149" class="calibre14" id="a149"></a></p>
<p class="title"> “showing how greatly the introduction of new machines had superseded the labour of preceding periods.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n148" class="calibre1">[148]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title">In certain cases, the increase in the number of hands employed is only apparent; that is,
it is not due to the extension of the factories already established, but
to the gradual annexation of connected trades; for instance, the increase
in power-looms, and in the hands employed by them between 1838 and 1856,
was, in the cotton trade, simply owing to the extension of this branch
of industry; but in the other trades to the application of steam-power
to the carpet-loom, to the ribbon-loom, and to the linen-loom, which previously
had been worked by the power of men. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n149" class="calibre1">[149]</a></sup> Hence the increase of the hands in these latter trades was merely a symptom of a
diminution in the total number employed. Finally, we have considered this
question entirely apart from the fact, that everywhere, except in the metal
industries, young persons (under 18), and women and children form the preponderating
element in the class of factory hands.
</p>
<p class="title">Nevertheless, in spite of the mass of hands actually displaced
and <!--423-->virtually replaced by machinery, we can understand how the
factory operatives, through the building of more mills and the extension
of old ones in a given industry, may become more numerous than the manufacturing
workmen and handicraftsman that have been displaced. Suppose, for example,
that in the old mode of production, a capital of £500 is employed
weekly, two-fifths being constant and three-fifths variable capital, <em class="calibre11">i.e.</em>,
£200 being laid out in means of production, and £300, say £1
per man, in labour-power. On the introduction of machinery the composition
of this capital becomes altered. We will suppose it to consist of four-fifths
constant and one-fifth variable, which means that only £100 is now
laid out in labour-power. Consequently, two-thirds of the workmen are discharged.
If now the business extends, and the total capital employed grows to £1,500
under unchanged conditions, the number of operatives employed will increase
to 300, just as many as before the introduction of the machinery. If the
capital further grows to £2,000, 400 men will be employed, or one-third
more than under the old system. Their numbers have, in point of fact, increased
by 100, but relatively, i.e., in proportion to the total capital advanced,
they have diminished by 800, for the £2,000 capital would, in the
old state of things, have employed 1,200 instead of 400 men. Hence, a relative
decrease in the number of hands is consistent with an actual increase.
We assumed above that while the total capital increases, its composition
remains the same, because the conditions of production remain constant.
But we have already seen that, with every advance in the use of machinery,
the constant component of capital, that part which consists of machinery,
raw material, &amp;c., increases, while the variable component, the part
laid out in labour-power, decreases. We also know that in no, other system
of production is improvement so continuous, and the composition of the
capital employed so constantly changing as in the factory system. These
changes are, however, continually interrupted by periods of rest, during
which there is a mere quantitative extension of the factories on the existing
technical basis. <a name="a150" class="calibre14" id="a150"></a>During such periods the operatives increase in number..
Thus, in 1835, the total number of operatives in the cotton, woollen, worsted,
flax, and silk factories of the United Kingdom was only 354,684; while
in 1861 the number of the power-loom weavers alone (of both sexes and of
all ages, from eight years upwards), amounted to 230,654. Certainly, this
growth appears less important when we consider that in 1838 the hand-loom
weavers with their families still numbered 800,000, <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n150" class="calibre1">[150]</a></sup> not to mention <!--424-->those thrown out of work in Asia, and on the Continent of Europe.
</p>
<p class="title">In the few remarks I have still to make on this point, I shall
refer to some actually existing relations, the existence of which our theoretical
investigation has not yet disclosed.
</p>
<p class="title">So long as, in a given branch of industry, the factory system
extends itself at the expense of the old handicrafts or of manufacture,
the result is as sure as is the result of an encounter between an army
furnished with breach-loaders, and one armed with bows and arrows. This
first period, during which machinery conquers its field of action, is of
decisive importance owing to the extraordinary profits that it helps to
produce. These profits not only form a source of accelerated accumulation,
but also attract into the favoured sphere of production a large part of
the additional social capital that is being constantly created, and is
ever on the look-out for new investments. The special advantages of this
first period of fast and furious activity are felt in every branch of production
that machinery invades. So soon, however, as the factory system has gained
a certain breadth of footing and a definite degree of maturity, and, especially,
so soon as its technical basis, machinery, is itself produced by machinery;
so soon as coal mining and iron mining, the metal industries, and the means
of transport have been revolutionised; so soon, in short, as the general
conditions requisite for production by the modern industrial system have
been established, this mode of production acquires an elasticity, <a name="a151" class="calibre14" id="a151"></a>
<a name="a152" class="calibre14" id="a152"></a>a capacity for sudden extension by leaps and bounds that finds no hindrance except in the supply of raw material and in the disposal of the produce. On the
one hand, the immediate effect of machinery is to increase the supply of
raw material in the same way, for example, as the cotton gin augmented
the production of cotton. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n151" class="calibre1">[151]</a></sup> On the other hand,
the cheapness of the articles produced by machinery, and the improved means
of transport and communication furnish the weapons for conquering foreign
markets. By ruining handicraft production in other countries, machinery
forcibly converts them into fields for the supply of its raw material.
In this way East India was compelled to produce cotton, wool, hemp, jute,
and indigo for Great Britain. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n152" class="calibre1">[152]</a></sup> By constantly
making a part of the <a name="a153" class="calibre14" id="a153"></a><a name="a154" class="calibre14" id="a154"></a>hands “supernumerary,” modern industry, in all countries where it has taken root, gives a spur to emigration and <!--425-->to the colonisation of foreign lands, which are thereby converted into settlements for growing the raw material of the mother country; just as Australia,
for example, was converted into a colony for growing wool. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n153" class="calibre1">[153]</a></sup> A new and international division of labour, a division suited to the requirements of the chief centres of modern industry springs up, and converts one part of the globe into a chiefly agricultural field of production, for supplying
the other part which remains a chiefly industrial field. This revolution
hangs together with radical changes in agriculture which we need not here
further inquire into. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n154" class="calibre1">[154]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title">On the motion of Mr. Gladstone, the House of Commons ordered,
on the 17th February, 1867, a return of the total quantities of grain,
corn, and flour, of all sorts, imported into, and exported from, the United
Kingdom, between the years 1831 and 1866. I give below a summary of the
result. The flour is given in quarters of corn. (See the Table on p. 42.6.)

</tr></table><p class="title">The enormous power, inherent in the factory system, of expanding by jumps,
and the dependence of that system on the markets of the world, necessarily
beget feverish production, followed by over-filling of the markets, whereupon
contraction of the markets brings on crippl<!--427-->ing of production. The
life of modern industry becomes a series of periods of moderate activity,
prosperity, over-production, crisis and stagnation. The uncertainty and
instability to which machinery subjects the employment, and consequently
the conditions of existence, of the operatives become normal, owing to
these periodic changes of the industrial cycle. <a name="a156" class="calibre14" id="a156"></a>Except in the periods of
prosperity, there rages between the capitalists the most furious combat
for the share of each in the markets. This share is directly proportional
to the cheapness of the. product. Besides the rivalry that this struggle
begets in the application of improved machinery for replacing labour-power,
and of new methods of production, there also comes a time in every industrial
cycle, when a forcible reduction of wages beneath the value of labour-power,
is attempted for the purpose of cheapening commodities. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n156" class="calibre1">[156]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title">A necessary condition, therefore, to the growth of the number
of factory hands, is a proportionally much more rapid growth of the amount
of capital invested in mills. This growth, however, is conditioned by the
ebb and flow of the industrial cycle. It is, besides, constantly interrupted
by the technical progress that at one time virtually supplies the place
of new workmen, at another, actually displaces old ones. This qualitative
change in mechanical industry continually discharges hands from the factory,
or shuts its doors against the fresh stream of recruits, while the purely
quantitative extension of the factories absorbs not only the men <!--428-->thrown
out of work, but also fresh contingents. The workpeople are thus continually
both repelled and attracted, hustled from pillar to post, while, at the
same time, constant changes take place in the sex, age, and skill of the
levies.
</p>
<p class="title">The lot of the factory operatives will be best depicted by taking
a rapid survey of the course of the English cotton industry.
</p>
<p class="title">From 1770 to 1815 this trade was depressed or stagnant for 5 years
only. During this period of 45 years the English manufacturers had a monopoly
of machinery and of the markets of the world. From 1815 to 1821 depression;
1822 and 1823 prosperity; 1824 abolition of the laws against Trades’ Unions,
great extension of factories everywhere; 1825 crisis; 1826 great misery
and riots among the factory operatives; 1827 slight improvement; 1828 great
increase in power-looms, and in exports; 1829 exports, especially to India,
surpass all former years; 1830 glutted markets, great distress; 1831 to
1833 continued depression, the monopoly of the trade with India and China
withdrawn from the, East India Company; 1834 great increase of factories
and machinery, shortness of hands. The new poor law furthers the migration
of agricultural labourers into the factory districts. The country districts
swept of children. White slave trade; 1835 great prosperity, contemporaneous
starvation of the hand-loom weavers; 1836 great prosperity; 1837 and 1838
depression and crisis; 1839 revival; 1840 great depression, riots, calling
out of the military; 1841 and 1842 frightful suffering among the factory
operatives; 1842 the manufacturers lock the hands out of the factories
in order to enforce the repeal of the Corn Laws. The operatives stream
in thousands into the towns of Lancashire and Yorkshire, are driven back
by the military, and their leaders brought to trial at Lancaster; 1843
great misery; 1844 revival; 1845 great prosperity; 1846 continued improvement
at first, then reaction. Repeal of the Corn Laws; 1847 crisis, general
reduction of wages by 10 and more per cent. in honour of the “big loaf";
1848 continued depression; Manchester under military. protection; 1849
revival; 1850 prosperity; 1851 falling prices, low wages, frequent strikes;
1852 improvement begins, strikes continue, the manufacturers threaten to
import foreign hands; 1853 increasing exports. Strike for 8 months, and
great misery at Preston; 1854 prosperity, glutted markets; 1855 news of
failures stream in from the United States, Canada, and the Eastern markets;
1856 great prosperity; 1857 crisis; 1858 improvement; 1859 great prosperity,
increase in factories; 1860 Zenith of the English cotton trade, the Indian,
Australian, and other markets so glutted with goods that even in 1863 they
had not absorbed the whole lot; the French Treaty of Commerce, enormous
growth of factories and machinery; 1861 prosperity continues for a time,
reaction, the American Civil War, cotton famine: 1862 to 1863 complete
collapse.

<a name="a157" class="calibre14" id="a157"></a>
<a name="a158" class="calibre14" id="a158"></a></p>
<p class="title"><!--429-->The history of the cotton famine is too characteristic to
dispense with dwelling upon it for a moment. From the indications as to
the condition of the markets of the world in 1860 and 1861, we see that
the cotton famine came in the nick of time for the manufacturers, and was
to some extent advantageous to them, a fact that was acknowledged in the
reports of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce, proclaimed in Parliament
by Palmerston and Derby, and confirmed by events. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n157" class="calibre1">[157]</a></sup> No doubt, among the 2,887 cotton mills in the United Kingdom in 1861, there were many of small size. According to the report of Mr. A. Redgrave, out
of the 2,109 mills included in his district, 392, or 19% employed less
than ten horse-power each; 345, or 16% employed 10 H. P., and less than
20 H. P.; while 1,372 employed upwards of 20 H. P. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n158" class="calibre1">[158]</a></sup> The majority of the small mills were weaving sheds, built during the period of prosperity after 1858, for the most part by speculators, of whom one
supplied the yarn, another the machinery, a third the buildings, and were
worked by men who had been overlookers, or by other persons of small means.
These small manufacturers mostly went to the wall. The same fate would
have overtaken them in the commercial crisis that was staved off only by
the cotton famine. Although they formed one-third of the total number of
manufacturers, yet their mills absorbed a much smaller part of the capital
invested in the cotton trade. As to the extent of the stoppage, it appears
from authentic estimates, that in October 1862, 60.3% of the spindles,
and 58% of the looms were standing. This refers to the cotton trade as
a whole, and, of course, requires considerable modification for individual
districts. Only very few mills worked full time (60 hours a week), the
remainder worked at intervals. Even in those few cases where full time
was worked, and at the customary rate of piece-wage, the weekly wages of
the operatives necessarily shrank, owing to good cotton being replaced
by bad, Sea Island by Egyptian (in fine spinning mills), American and Egyptian
by Surat, and pure cotton by mixings of waste and Surat. The shorter fibre
of the Surat cotton and its dirty condition, the greater fragility of the
thread, the substitution of all sorts of heavy ingredients for flour in
sizing the warps, all these lessened the speed of the machinery, or the
number of the looms that could be superintended by one weaver, increased
the labour caused by defects in the machinery, and reduced the piece-wage
by reducing the mass of the product turned off. Where Surat cotton was
used, the loss to the operatives when on full time, amounted to 20, 30,
and more per cent. <a name="a159" class="calibre14" id="a159"></a>But besides this, the majority of the manufacturers
reduced the rate of piece-wage by 5, 7½, <!--430-->and 10 per cent.
We can therefore conceive the situation of those hands who were employed
for only 3, 3½ or 4 days a week, or for only 6 hours a day. Even in
1863, after a comparative improvement had set in, the weekly wages of spinners
and of weavers were 3s. 4d., 3s. 10d., 4s. 6d. and 5s. 1d. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n159" class="calibre1">[159]</a></sup> Even in this miserable state of things, however, the inventive spirit of the master never stood still, but was exercised in making deductions from
wages. These were to some extent inflicted as a penalty for defects in
the finished article that were really due to his bad cotton and to his
unsuitable machinery. Moreover, where the manufacturer owned the cottages
of the workpeople, he paid himself his rents by <a name="a160" class="calibre14" id="a160"></a><a name="a161" class="calibre14" id="a161"></a>deducting the amount from these miserable Wages. Mr. Redgrave tells us of self-acting minders (operatives
who manage a pair of self-acting mules)</p>
<p class="title">  “earning at the end of a fortnight’s
full work 8s. 11d., and that from this sum was deducted the rent of the
house, the manufacturer, however, returning half the rent as a gift. The
minders took away the sum of 6s. 11d. In many places the self-acting minders
ranged from 5s. to 9s. per week, and the weavers from 2s. to 6s. per week,
during the latter part of 1862.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n160" class="calibre1">[160]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title">Even when working short time the rent was frequently deducted from the wages of the operatives.
<sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n161" class="calibre1">[161]</a></sup> No wonder that in some parts of Lancashire a
kind of famine fever broke out. But more characteristic than all this,
was, the revolution that took place in the process of production at the
expense of the workpeople. Experimenta in corpore vili, like those of anatomists
on frogs, were formally made. <a name="a162" class="calibre14" id="a162"></a></p>
<p class="title"> “Although,” says Mr. Redgrave, “I have given
the actual earnings of the operatives in the several mills, it does not
follow that they earn the same amount week by week. The operatives are
subject to great fluctuation from the constant experimentalising of the
manufacturers ... the earnings of the operatives rise and fall with the
quality of the cotton mixings; sometimes they have been within 15 per cent.
of former earnings, and then, in a week or two, they have fallen off from
50 to 60 per cent.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n162" class="calibre1">[162]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title">These experiments were not made solely at the expense of the workman’s means of subsistence. His five
senses also had to pay the penalty.</p>
<p class="title">  “The people who are employed in making
up Surat cotton complain very much. They inform me, on opening the bales
of cotton there is an intolerable smell, which causes sickness.... In the
mixing, scribbling and carding rooms, the dust and dirt which are disengaged,
irritate the air passages, and give rise to cough and difficulty of breathing.
A disease of the skin, no doubt from the irritation of the dirt contained <!--431-->in
the Surat cotton, also prevails.... The fibre being so short, a great amount
of size, both animal and vegetable, is used.... Bronchitis is more prevalent
owing to the dust. Inflammatory sore throat is common, from the same cause.
Sickness and dyspepsia are produced by the frequent breaking of the weft,
when the weaver sucks the weft through the eye of the shuttle.” <a name="a163" class="calibre14" id="a163"></a><a name="a164" class="calibre14" id="a164"></a>On the other hand, the substitutes for flour were a Fortunatus’ purse to the manufacturers, by increasing the weight of the yarn. They caused “15 lbs. of raw material
to weigh 26 lbs. after it was woven.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n163" class="calibre1">[163]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title">In the Report of Inspectors of Factories for 30th April, 1864, we read as follows:</p>
<p class="title"> “The trade is availing itself of this resource at present to an extent
which is even discreditable. I have heard on good authority of a cloth
weighing 8 lbs. which was made of 5 1/4 lbs. cotton and 2 3/4 lbs. size;
and of another cloth weighing 5 1/4 lbs., of which 2 lbs. was size. These
were ordinary export shirtings. In cloths of other descriptions, as much
as 50 per cent. size is sometimes added; so that a manufacturer may, and
does truly boast, that he is getting rich by selling cloth for less money
per pound than he paid for the mere yarn of which they are composed.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n164" class="calibre1">[164]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title"> But the workpeople had to suffer, not only from the experiments of the manufacturers inside the mills, and of the municipalities outside, not
only from reduced wages and absence <a name="a165" class="calibre14" id="a165"></a>of work, from want and from charity,
and from the eulogistic speeches of lords and commons.</p>
<p class="title">  “Unfortunate females
who, in consequence of the cotton famine, were at its commencement thrown
out of employment, and have thereby become outcasts of society; and now,
though trade has revived, and work is plentiful, continue members of that
unfortunate class, and are likely to continue so. There are also in the
borough more youthful prostitutes than I have known for the last 25 years.” 
 <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n165" class="calibre1">[165]</a></sup><a name="a166" class="calibre14" id="a166"></a></p>

<p class="title">We find then, in the first 45 years of the English cotton trade,
from 1770 to 1815, only 5 years of crisis and stagnation; but this was
the period of monopoly. The second period from 1815 to 1863 counts, during
its 48 years, only 20 years of revival and prosperity against 28 of depression
and stagnation. Between 1815 and 1830 the competition with the continent
of Europe and with the United States sets in. After 1833, the extension
of the Asiatic markets is enforced by “destruction of the human race” (the
wholesale extinction of Indian hand-loom weavers). After the repeal of
the Corn Laws, from 1846 to 1863, there are 8 years of moderate activity
and prosperity against 9 years of de<!--432-->pression and stagnation. The
condition of the adult male operatives, even during the years of prosperity,
may be judged from the note subjoined. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n166" class="calibre1">[166]</a></sup></p>

<hr class="end1"/><a name="S8a" class="calibre14" id="S8a"></a>
<h4 class="calibre15">A. Overthrow of Co-operation Based on Handicraft, and on the Division of Labour</h4>

<a name="a167" class="calibre14" id="a167"></a>
<p class="title">We have seen how machinery does away with co-operation
based on handicrafts, and with manufacture based on the division of handicraft
labour. An example of the first sort is the mowing-machine; it replaces
co-operation between mowers. A striking example of the second kind, is
the needle-making machine. According to Adam Smith, 10 men, in his day,
made in co-operation, over 48,000 needles a-day. On the other hand, a single
needle-machine makes 145,000 in a working-day of 11 hours. One woman or
one girl superintends four such machines, and so produces near upon 600,000
needles in a day, and upwards of 3,000,000 in a week. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n167" class="calibre1">[167]</a></sup> A single machine, when it takes the place of co-<!--433-->operation or of manufacture, <a name="a168" class="calibre14" id="a168"></a>may itself serve as the basis of an industry of a handicraft character. Still, such a return to handicrafts is but a transition to the factory
system, which, as a rule, makes its appearance so soon as the human muscles
are replaced, for the purpose of driving the machines, by a mechanical
motive power, such as steam or water. Here and there, but in any case only
for a time, an industry may be carried on, on a small scale, by means of
mechanical power. This is effected by hiring steam-power, as is done in
some of the Birmingham trades, or by the use of small caloric-engines,
as in some branches of weaving. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n168" class="calibre1">[168]</a></sup> In the Coventry silk <a name="a169" class="calibre14" id="a169"></a>weaving industry the experiment of “cottage factories” was tried. In the centre of a square surrounded by rows of cottages, an engine-house
was built and the engine connected by shafts with the looms in the cottages.
In all cases the power was hired at so much per loom. The rent was payable
weekly, whether the looms worked or not. Each cottage held from 2 to 6
looms; some belonged to the weaver, some were bought on credit, some were
hired. The struggle between these cottage factories and the factory proper,
lasted over 12 years. It ended with the complete ruin of the 300 cottage
factories. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n169" class="calibre1">[169]</a></sup> Wherever the nature of the process
did not involve production on a large scale, the new industries that have
sprung up in the last few decades, such as envelope making, steel-pen making,
&amp;c., <a name="a170" class="calibre14" id="a170"></a>have, as a general rule, first passed through the handicraft stage,
and then the manufacturing stage, as short phases of transition to the
factory stage. The transition is very difficult in those cases where the
production of the article by manufacture consists, not of a series of graduated
processes, but of a great number of disconnected ones. This circumstance
formed a great hindrance to the establishment of steel-pen factories. Nevertheless,
about 15 years ago, a machine was invented that automatically performed
6 separate operations at once. The first steel-pens were supplied by the
handicraft system, in the year 1820, at £7 4s. the gross; in 1830
they-were supplied by manufacture at 8s., and today the factory system
supplies them to the trade at from 2 to 6d. the gross. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n170" class="calibre1">[170]</a></sup></p>

<a name="S8b" class="calibre14" id="S8b"></a>
<h4 class="calibre15">B. Reaction of the Factory System on Manufacture and Domestic Industries</h4>

<p class="title">Along with the development of the factory system and of the revolution
in agriculture that accompanies it, production in all the other branches
of industry not only extends, but alters its character. The principle,
carried out in the factory system, of analysing the process of production
into its constituent phases, and of solving the problems thus proposed
by the application of mechanics, of chemistry, and of the whole range of
the natural sciences, becomes the determining principle everywhere. Hence,
machinery squeezes itself into the manufacturing industries first for one
detail process, then for another. Thus the solid crystal of their organisation,
based on the old division of labour, becomes dissolved, and makes way for
constant changes. Independently of this, a radical change takes place in
the composition of the collective labourer, a change of the persons working
in combination. In contrast with the manufacturing period, the division
of labour is thenceforth based, wherever possible, on the employment of
women, of children of all ages, and of unskilled labourers, in one word,
on cheap labour, as it is characteristically called in England. This is
the case not only with all production on a large scale, whether employing
machinery or not, but also with the so-called domestic industry, whether
carried on in the houses of the workpeople or in small workshops. This
modern so-called domestic industry has nothing, except the name, in common
with the old-fashioned domestic industry, the existence of which pre-supposes
independent urban handicrafts, independent peasant farming, and above all,
a dwelling-house for the labourer and his family. <a name="a171" class="calibre14" id="a171"></a>That old-fashioned industry
has now been converted into an outside department of the factory, the manufactory,
or the warehouse. Besides the factory operatives, the manufacturing workmen
and the handicraftsman, whom it concentrates in large masses at one spot,
and directly commands, capital also sets in motion, by means, of invisible
threads, another army; that of the workers in the domestic industries,
who dwell in the large towns and -are also scattered over the face of the
country. An example: The shirt factory of Messrs. Tillie at Londonderry,
which employs 1,000 operatives in the factory itself, and 9,000 people
spread up and down the country and working in their own houses. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n171" class="calibre1">[171]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title">The exploitation of cheap and immature labour-power is carried
out in a more shameless manner in modern Manufacture than in the factory
proper. This is because the technical foundation of the factory system,
namely, the substitution of machines for muscular power, and the light character
of the labour, is almost entirely absent in Manufacture, and at the same
time women and over-young children are subjected, in a most unconscionable
way, to the influence of poisonous or injurious substances. This exploitation
is more shameless in the so-called domestic industry than in manufactures,
and that because the power of resistance in the labourers decreases with
their dissemination; because a whole series of plundering parasites insinuate
themselves between the employer and the workman; because a domestic industry
has always to compete either with the factory system, or with manufacturing
in the same branch of production; because poverty robs the workman of the
conditions most essential to his labour, of space, light and ventilation;
because employment becomes more and more irregular; and, finally, because
in these the last resorts of the masses made “redundant” by modern industry
and Agriculture, competition for work attains its maximum. Economy in the
means of production, first systematically carried out in the factory system,
and there, from the very beginning, coincident with the most reckless squandering
of labour-power, and robbery of the conditions normally requisite for labour
— this economy now shows its antagonistic and murderous side more and
more in a given branch of industry, the less the social productive power
of labour and the technical basis for a combination of processes are developed
in that branch.

<h4 class="calibre15">C. Modern Manufacture</h4>

<a name="a172" class="calibre14" id="a172"></a>
<a name="a173" class="calibre14" id="a173"></a>
<a name="a174" class="calibre14" id="a174"></a>
<p class="title">I now proceed, by a few examples, to illustrate the principles laid
down above. As a matter of fact, the reader is already familiar with numerous
instances given in the chapter on the working-day. In the hardware manufactures
of Birmingham and the neighbourhood, there are employed, mostly in very
heavy work, 30,000 children and young persons, besides 10,000 women. There
they are to be seen in the unwholesome brass-foundries, button factories,
enamelling, galvanising, and lackering works. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n172" class="calibre1">[172]</a></sup>
Owing to the excessive labour of their workpeople, both adult and non-adult,
certain London houses where newspapers and books are printed, have got
the ill-omened name of “slaughterhouses.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n173" class="calibre1">[173]</a></sup> Similar excesses are practised in book-binding, where the victims are chiefly women,
girls, and children; young persons have to do heavy work in rope-walks
and night-work in salt mines, candle manufactories, and chemical works;
young people are worked to death at turning the looms in silk weaving,
when it is not carried on by machinery. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n174" class="calibre1">[174]</a></sup><!--436-->One of the most shameful, the most dirty, and the worst paid kinds of labour, and one on which women and young girls are by preference employed, is the
sorting of rags. <a name="a175" class="calibre14" id="a175"></a>It is well known that Great Britain, apart from its own
immense store of rags, is the emporium for the rag trade of the whole world.
They flow in from Japan, from the most remote States of South America,
and from the Canary Islands. But the chief sources of their supply are
Germany, France, Russia, Italy, Egypt, Turkey, Belgium, and Holland. They
are used for manure, for making bedflocks, for shoddy, and they serve as
the raw material of paper. The rag-sorters are the medium for the spread
of small-pox and other infectious diseases, and they themselves are the
first victims. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n175" class="calibre1">[175]</a></sup> A classical example of over-work, of hard and inappropriate labour, and of its brutalising effects on the
workman from his childhood upwards, is afforded not only by coal-mining
and miners generally, but also by tile and brick making, in which industry
the recently invented machinery is, in England, used only here and there.
Between May and September the work lasts from 5 in the morning till 8 in
the evening, and where the drying is done in the open air, it often lasts
from 4 in the morning till 9 in the evening. Work from 5 in the morning
till 7 in the evening is considered “reduced” and “moderate.” Both boys
and girls of 6 and even of 4 years of age are employed. They work for the
same number of hours, often longer, than the adults. The work is hard and
the summer heat increases the exhaustion. In a certain tile-field at Mosley,
e.g., a young woman, 24 years of age, was in the habit of making 2,000
tiles a day, with the assistance of 2 little girls, who carried the clay
for her, and stacked the tiles. These girls carried daily 10 tons up the
slippery sides of the clay pits, from a depth of 30 feet, and then for
a distance of 210 feet.</p>
<p class="title">  “It is impossible for a child to pass through the
purgatory of a tile-field without great moral degradation... the low language,
which they are accustomed to hear from their tenderest years, the filthy,
indecent, and shameless habits, amidst which, unknowing, and half wild,
they grow up, make them in after-life lawless, abandoned, dissolute....
A frightful source of demoralisation is the mode of living. Each moulder,
who is always a skilled labourer, and the chief of a group, supplies his
7 subordinates with board and lodging in his cottages Whether members of
his family or not, the men, boys, and girls all sleep in the cottage, which
contains generally two, exceptionally 3 rooms, all on the ground floor,
and badly ventilated. These people are so exhausted after the day’s hard
work, that neither the rules of health, of cleanliness, nor of decency
are in the least observed. Many of these <!--437-->cottages are models
of untidiness, dirt, and dust.... The greatest evil of the system that
employs young girls on this sort of work, consists in this, that, as a
rule, it chains them fast from childhood for the whole of their after-life
to the most abandoned rabble. <a name="a176" class="calibre14" id="a176"></a>They become rough, foul-mouthed boys, before
Nature has taught them that they are women. Clothed in a few dirty rags,
the legs naked far above the knees, hair and face besmeared with dirt,
they learn to treat all feelings of decency and of shame with contempt.
During meal-times they lie at full length in the fields, or watch the boys
bathing in a neighbouring canal. Their heavy day’s work at length completed,
they put on better clothes, and accompany the men to the public houses.” </p>
<p class="title">That excessive insobriety is prevalent from childhood upwards among the
whole of this class, is only natural.</p>
<p class="title">  “The worst is that the brickmakers
despair of themselves. You might as well, said one of the better kind to
a chaplain of Southallfield, try to raise and improve the devil as a brickie,
sir!” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n176" class="calibre1">[176]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title">As to the manner, in which capital effects an economy in the requisites
of labour, in modern Manufacture (in which I include all workshops of larger
size, except factories proper), official and most ample material bearing
on it is to be found in the Public Health Reports IV. (1863) and VI. (1864).
The description of the Workshops, more especially those of the London printers
and tailors, surpasses the most loathsome phantasies of our romance writers-
The effect on the health of the workpeople is self-evident. Dr. Simon,
the chief medical officer of the Privy Council and the official editor
of the “Public Health Reports,” says:</p>
<p class="title">  “In my fourth Report (1863) I showed,
how it is practically impossible for the workpeople to insist upon that
which is their first sanitary right, viz., <a name="a177" class="calibre14" id="a177"></a><a name="a178" class="calibre14" id="a178"></a>the right that, no matter what the work for which their employer brings them together, the labour, so
far as it depends upon him, should be freed from all avoidably unwholesome
conditions. I pointed out, that while the workpeople are practically incapable
of doing themselves this sanitary justice, they are unable to obtain any
effective support from the paid administrations of the sanitary police....
The life of myriads of workmen and workwomen is now uselessly tortured
and shortened by the never-ending physical suffering that their mere occupation
begets.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n177" class="calibre1">[177]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title">In illustration of the way in which
the workrooms influence the state of health Dr. Simon gives the following
