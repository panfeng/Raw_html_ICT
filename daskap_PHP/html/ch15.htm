<hr class="end1"/><a name="a1" class="calibre14" id="a1"></a>
<p class="title">John Stuart Mill says in his “Principles of Political
Economy":</p>
<p class="title"> “It is questionable if all the mechanical inventions yet made
have lightened the day’s toil of any human being.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n1" class="calibre1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title">That is, however, by no means the aim of the capitalistic application of machinery. Like every other increase in the productiveness of labour, machinery is intended to cheapen commodities, and, by shortening that portion of
the working-day, in which the labourer works for himself, to lengthen the
other portion that he gives, without an equivalent, to the capitalist.
In short, it is a means for producing surplus-value.</p>
<p class="title">In manufacture, the revolution in the mode of production begins
with the labour-power, in modern industry it begins with the instruments
of labour. Our first inquiry then is, how the instruments of labour are
converted from tools into machines, or what is the difference between a
machine and the implements of a handicraft? We are only concerned here
with striking and general characteristics; for epochs in the history of
society are no more separated from each other by hard and fast lines of
demarcation, than are geological epochs.

<a name="a2" class="calibre14" id="a2"></a>
<a name="a3" class="calibre14" id="a3"></a></p>
<p class="title">Mathematicians and mechanicians, and in this they are followed
by a few English economists, call a tool a simple machine, and a machine
a complex tool. They see no essential difference between them, and even
give the name of machine to the simple mechanical powers, the lever, the
inclined plane, the screw, the wedge, &amp;c. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n2" class="calibre1">[2]</a></sup> As
a matter of fact, every machine is a combination of those simple powers,
no matter how they <!--352-->may be disguised. From the economic standpoint
this explanation is worth nothing, because the historical element is wanting.
Another explanation of the difference between tool and machine is that
in the case of a tool, man is the motive power, while the motive power
of a machine is something different from man, as, for instance, an animal,
water, wind, and so on.<sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n3" class="calibre1">[3]</a></sup><a name="a4" class="calibre14" id="a4"></a>According to this, a plough drawn by oxen, which is a contrivance common to the most different epochs,
would be a machine, while Claussen’s circular loom, which, worked by a
single labourer, weaves 96,000 picks per minute, would be a mere tool.
Nay, this very loom, though a tool when worked by hand, would, if worked
by steam, be a machine. And since the application of animal power is one
of man’s earliest inventions, production by machinery would have preceded
production by handicrafts. When in 1735, John Wyatt brought out his spinning
machine, and began the industrial revolution of the 18th century, not a
word did he say about an ass driving it instead of a man, and yet this
part fell to the ass. He described it as a machine “to spin without fingers.” 
 <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n4" class="calibre1">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title">All fully developed machinery consists of three essentially different
parts, the motor mechanism, the transmitting mechanism, and finally the
tool or working machine. The motor mechanism is that which puts <!--353-->the
whole in motion. It either generates its own motive power, like the steam-engine,
the caloric engine, the electromagnetic machine, &amp;c., or it receives
its impulse from some already existing natural force, like the water-wheel
from a head of water, the wind-mill from wind, &amp;c. The transmitting
mechanism, composed of fly-wheels, shafting, toothed wheels, pullies, straps,
ropes, bands, pinions, and gearing of the most varied kinds, regulates
the motion, changes its form. where necessary, as for instance, from linear
to circular, and divides and distributes it among the working machines.
These two first parts of the whole mechanism are there, solely for putting
the working machines in motion, by means of which motion the subject of
labour is seized upon and modified as desired. The tool or working machine
is that part of the machinery with which the industrial revolution of the
18th century started. And to this day it constantly serves as such a starting-point,
whenever a handicraft, or a manufacture, is turned into an industry carried
on by machinery.

<a name="a5" class="calibre14" id="a5"></a>
<a name="a6" class="calibre14" id="a6"></a></p>
<p class="title">On a closer examination of the working machine proper, we find
in it, as a general rule, though often, no doubt, under very altered forms,
the apparatus and tools used by the handicraftsman or manufacturing workman;
with this difference, that instead of being human implements, they are
the implements of a mechanism, or mechanical implements. Either the entire
machine is only a more or less altered mechanical edition of the old handicraft
tool, as, for instance, the power-loom,<sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n5" class="calibre1">[5]</a></sup> or the working parts fitted in the frame of the machine are old acquaintances, as spindles
are in a mule, needles in a stocking-loom, saws in a sawing-machine, and
knives in a chopping machine. The distinction between these tools and the
body proper of the machine, exists from their very birth; for they continue
for the most part to be produced by handicraft, or by manufacture, and
are afterwards fitted into the body of the machine, which is the product
of machinery. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n6" class="calibre1">[6]</a></sup> The machine proper is therefore a mechanism that, after being set in motion, performs with its tools the same operations
that were formerly done by the workman with similar tools. Whether the
motive power is derived from man, or from some other machine, makes no
difference in this respect. From the moment that the tool proper is taken
from m-an, and fitted into a mecha<!--354-->nism, a machine takes the place
of a mere implement. The difference strikes one at once, even in those
cases where man himself continues to be the prime mover. The number of
implements that he himself can use simultaneously, is limited by the number
of his own natural instruments of production, by the number of his bodily
organs. In Germany, they tried at first to make one spinner work two spinning-wheels,
that is, to work simultaneously with both hands and both feet. This was
too difficult. Later, a treddle spinning-wheel with two spindles was invented,
but adepts in spinning, who could spin two threads at once, were almost
as scarce as two-headed men. The Jenny, on the other hand, even at its
very birth, spun with 12-18 spindles, and the stocking-loom knits with
many thousand needles at once. The number of tools that a machine can bring
into play simultaneously, is from the very first emancipated from the organic
limits that hedge in the tools of a handicraftsman.

<a name="a7" class="calibre14" id="a7"></a>
<a name="a8" class="calibre14" id="a8"></a></p>
<p class="title">In many manual implements the distinction between man as mere
motive power, and man as the workman or operator properly so called, is
brought into striking contrast. For instance, the foot is merely the prime
mover of the spinning-wheel, while the hand, working with the spindle,
and drawing and twisting, performs the real operation of spinning. It is
this last part of the handicraftsman’s implement that is first seized upon
by the industrial revolution, leaving to the workman, in addition to his
new labour of watching the machine with his eyes and correcting its mistakes
with his hands, the merely mechanical part of being the moving power. On
the other hand, implements, in regard to which man has always acted as
a simple motive power, as, for instance, by turning the crank of a mill,
<sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n7" class="calibre1">[7]</a></sup> by pumping, by moving up and down the arm of a bellows, by pounding with a mortar, &amp;c., such implements soon call for the application
of animals, water <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n8" class="calibre1">[8]</a></sup> and wind as motive powers. Here
and there, long before the period of manufacture, and also, to some extent,
during that period, these implements pass over into machines, but without
creating any revolution in the mode of <!--355-->production. It becomes
evident, in the period of modern industry, that these implements, even
under their form of manual tools, are already machines. For instance, the
pumps with which the Dutch, in 1836-7, emptied the Lake of <a name="a9" class="calibre14" id="a9"></a>Harlem, were
constructed on the principle of ordinary pumps; the only difference being,
that their pistons were driven by cyclopean steam-engines, instead of by
men. The common and very imperfect bellows of the blacksmith is, in England,
occasionally converted into a blowing-engine, by connecting its arm with
a steam-engine. The steam-engine itself, such as it was at its invention,
during the manufacturing period at the close of the 17th century, and such
as it continued to be down to 1780, <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n9" class="calibre1">[9]</a></sup> did not give
rise to any industrial revolution. It was, on the contrary, the invention
of machines that made a revolution in the form of steam-engines necessary.
As soon as man, instead of working with an implement on the subject of
his labour, becomes merely the motive power of an implement-machine, it
is a mere accident that motive power takes the disguise of human muscle;
and it may equally well take the form of wind, water or steam. Of course,
this does not prevent such a change of form from producing great technical
alterations in the mechanism that was originally constructed to be driven
by man alone. Now-a-days, all machines that have their way to make, such
as sewing-machines, bread-making machines, &amp;c., are, unless from their
very nature their use on a small scale is excluded, constructed to be driven
both by human and by purely mechanical motive power.

<a name="a10" class="calibre14" id="a10"></a></p>
<p class="title">The machine, which is the starting-point of the industrial revolution,
supersedes the workman, who handles a single tool, by a mechanism operating
with a number of similar tools, and set in motion by a single motive power,
whatever the form of that power may be. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n10" class="calibre1">[10]</a></sup> Here we
have the machine, but only as an elementary factor of production by machinery.

<a name="a11" class="calibre14" id="a11"></a></p>
<p class="title">Increase in the size of the machine, and in the number of its
working tools, calls for a more massive mechanism to drive it; and this
mechanism requires, in order to overcome its resistance, a mightier moving
power than that of man, apart from the fact that man is a very imperfect
instrument for producing uniform continued motion. But assuming that he
is acting simply as a motor, that a machine has taken the place of his
tool, it is evident that he can be replaced by natural forces. Of all the
great motors handed down from the manufacturing period, horse-<!--356-->power
is the worst, partly because a horse has a head of his own, partly because
he is costly, and the extent to which he is applicable in factories is
very restricted.<sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n11" class="calibre1">[11]</a></sup> Nevertheless the horse was extensively used during the infancy of modern industry. This is proved, as well by
the complaints of contemporary agriculturists, as by the term “horse-power,” 
 which has survived to this day as an expression for mechanical force.
</p>
<p class="title">Wind was too inconstant and uncontrollable, and besides, in England,
the birthplace of modern industry, the use of water power preponderated
even during the manufacturing period. <a name="a12" class="calibre14" id="a12"></a><a name="a13" class="calibre14" id="a13"></a>In the 17th century attempts had already been made to turn two pairs of millstones with a single water-wheel.
But the increased size of the gearing was too much for the water power,
which had now become insufficient, and this was one of the circumstances
that led to a more accurate investigation of the laws of friction. In the
same way the irregularity caused by the motive power in mills that were
put in motion by pushing and pulling a lever, led to the theory, and the
application, of the fly-wheel, which afterwards plays so important a part
in modern industry. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n12" class="calibre1">[12]</a></sup> In this way, during the manufacturing period, were developed the first scientific and technical elements of Modern
Mechanical Industry. Arkwright’s throstle spinning mill was from the very
first turned by water. But for all that, the use of water, as the predominant
motive power, was beset with difficulties. It could not be increased at
will, it failed at certain seasons of the year, and, above all, it was
essentially local. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n13" class="calibre1">[13]</a></sup> Not till the invention of Watt’s <a name="a14" class="calibre14" id="a14"></a>second and so-called double-acting steam-engine, was a prime<!--357--> mover
found, that begot its own force by the consumption of coal and water, whose
power was entirely under man’s control, that was mobile and a means of
locomotion, that was urban and not, like the waterwheel, rural, that permitted
production to be concentrated in towns instead of, like the water-wheels,
being scattered up and down the country, <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n14" class="calibre1">[14]</a></sup> that was of universal technical application, and, relatively speaking, little affected
in its choice of residence by local circumstances. The greatness of Watt’s
genius showed itself in the specification of the patent that he took out
in April, 1784. In that specification his steam-engine is described, not
as an invention for a specific purpose, but as an agent universally applicable
in Mechanical Industry. In it he points out applications, many of which,
as for instance, the steam-hammer, were not introduced till half a century
later. Nevertheless he doubted the use of steam-engines in navigation.
His successors, Boulton and Watt, sent to the exhibition of 1851 steam-engines
of colossal size for ocean steamers.
</p>
<p class="title">As soon as tools had been converted from being manual implements
of man into implements of a mechanical apparatus, of a machine, the motive
mechanism also acquired an independent form, entirely emancipated from
the restraints of human strength. Thereupon the individual machine, that
we have hitherto been considering, sinks into a mere factor in production
by machinery. One motive mechanism was now able to drive many machines
at once. The motive mechanism grows with the number of the machines that
are turned simultaneously, and the transmitting mechanism becomes a wide-spreading
apparatus.
</p>
<p class="title">We now proceed to distinguish the co-operation of a number of
machines of one kind from a complex system of machinery.

<a name="a15" class="calibre14" id="a15"></a></p>
<p class="title">In the one case, the product is entirely made by a single machine,
which performs all the various operations previously done by one handicraftsman
with his tool; as, for instance, by a weaver with his loom; or by several
handicraftsman successively, either separately or as members of a system
of Manufacture. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n15" class="calibre1">[15]</a></sup> For example, in the manufacture<!--358--> of envelopes, one man folded the paper with the folder, another laid on
the gum, a third turned the flap over, on which the device is impressed,
a fourth embossed the device, and so on; and for each of these operations
the envelope had to change hands. One single envelope machine now performs
all these operations at once, and makes more than 3,000 envelopes in an
hour. In the London exhibition of 1862, there was an American machine for
making paper cornets. It cut the paper, pasted, folded, and finished 300
in a minute. Here, the whole process, which, when carried on as Manufacture,
was split up into, and carried out by, a series of operations, is completed
by a single machine, working a combination of various tools. Now, whether
such a machine be merely a reproduction of a complicated manual implement,
or a combination of various simple implements specialised by Manufacture,
in either case, in the factory, <em class="calibre11">i.e</em>., in the workshop in which machinery
alone is used, we meet again with simple co-operation; and, leaving the
workman out of consideration for the moment, this co-operation presents
itself to us, in the first instance, as the conglomeration in one place
of similar and simultaneously acting machines. Thus, a weaving factory
is constituted of a number of power-looms, working side by side, and a
sewing factory of a number of sewing-machines all in the same building.
But there is here a technical oneness in the whole system, owing to all
the machines receiving their impulse simultaneously, and in an equal degree,
from the pulsations of the common prime mover, by the intermediary of the
transmitting mechanism; and this mechanism, to a certain extent, is also
common to them all, since only particular ramifications of it branch off
to each machine. Just as a number of tools, then, form the organs of a
machine, so a number of machines of one kind constitute the organs of the
motive mechanism.

<a name="a16" class="calibre14" id="a16"></a></p>
<p class="title">A real machinery system, however, does not take the place of these
independent machines, until the subject of labour goes through a connected
series of detail processes, that are carried out by a chain of machines
of various kinds, the one supplementing the other. Here we have again the
co-operation by division of labour that characterises Manufacture; only
now, it is a combination of detail machines. The special tools of the various
detail workmen, such as those of the beaters, cambers, spinners, &amp;c.,
in the woollen manufacture, are now transformed into the tools of specialised
machines, each machine constituting a <!--359-->special organ, with a
special function, in the system. In those branches of industry in which
the machinery system is first introduced, Manufacture itself furnishes,
in a general way, the natural basis for the division, and consequent organisation,
of the process of production. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n16" class="calibre1">[16]</a></sup> Nevertheless an essential <a name="a17" class="calibre14" id="a17"></a>difference at once manifests itself. In Manufacture it is the workmen who, with their manual implements, must, either singly or in groups, carry on
each particular detail process. If, on the one hand, the workman becomes
adapted to the process, on the other, the process was previously made suitable
to the workman. This subjective principle of the division of labour no
longer exists in production by machinery. Here, the process as a whole
is examined objectively, in itself, that is to say, without regard to the
question of its execution by human hands, it is analysed into its constituent
phases; and the problem, how to execute each detail process, and bind them
all into a whole, is solved by the aid of machines, chemistry, &amp;c.
<sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n17" class="calibre1">[17]</a></sup> But, of course, in this case also, theory must
be perfected by accumulated experience on a large scale. Each detail machine
supplies raw material to the machine next in order; and since they are
all working at the same time, the product is always going through the various
stages of its fabrication, and is also constantly in a state of transition,
from one phase to another. Just as in Manufacture, the direct co-operation
of the detail labourers establishes a numerical proportion between the
special groups, so in an organised system of machinery, where one detail
machine is constantly kept employed by another, a fixed relation is established
between their numbers, their size, and their speed. The collective machine,
now an organised system of various kinds of single machines, and of groups
of <!--360-->single machines, becomes more and more perfect, the more
the process as a whole becomes a continuous one, i.e., the less the raw
material is interrupted in its passage from its first phase to its last;
in other words, the more its passage from one phase to another is effected,
not by the hand of man, but by the machinery itself. In Manufacture the
isolation of each detail process is a condition imposed by the nature of
division of labour, but in the fully developed factory the continuity of
those processes is, on the contrary, imperative.
</p>
<p class="title">A system of machinery, whether it reposes on the mere co-operation
of similar machines, as in weaving, or on a combination of different machines,
as in spinning, constitutes in itself a huge automaton, whenever it is
driven by a self-acting prime mover. But although the factory as a whole
be driven by its steam-engine, yet either some of the individual machines
may require the aid of the workman for some of their movements (such aid
was necessary for the running in of the mule carriage, before the invention
of the self-acting mule, and is still necessary in fine-spinning mills);
or, to enable a machine to do its work, certain parts of it may require
to be handled by the workman like a manual tool; this was the case in machine-makers’
workshops, before the conversion of the slide rest into a self-actor. As
soon as a machine executes, without man’s help, all the movements requisite
to elaborate the raw material, needing only attendance from him, we have
an automatic system of machinery, and one that is susceptible of constant
improvement in its details. Such improvements as the apparatus that stops
a drawing frame, whenever a sliver breaks, and the self-acting stop, that
stops the power-loom so soon as the shuttle bobbin is emptied of weft,
are quite modern inventions. As an example, both of continuity of production,
and of the carrying out of the automatic principle, we may take a modern
paper mill. In the paper industry generally, we may advantageously study
in detail not only the distinctions between modes of production based on
different means of production, but also the connexion of the social conditions
of production with those modes: for the old German paper-making furnishes
us with a sample of handicraft production; that of Holland in the 17th
and of France in the 18th century with a sample of manufacturing in the
strict sense; and that of modern England with a sample of automatic fabrication
of this article. Besides these, there still exist, in India and China,
two distinct antique Asiatic forms of the same industry.
</p>
<p class="title">An organised system of machines, to which motion is communicated
by the transmitting mechanism from a central automaton, is the most developed
form of production by machinery. Here we have, in the place of the isolated
machine, a mechanical monster whose body fills whole factories, and whose
demon power, at first veiled under the slow and <!--361-->measured motions
of his giant limbs, at length breaks out into the fast and furious whirl
of his countless working organs.
</p>
<p class="title">There were mules and steam-engines before there were any labourers,
whose exclusive occupation it was to make mules and steam-engines; just
as men wore clothes before there were such people as tailors. The inventions
of Vaucanson, Arkwright, Watt, and others, were, however, practicable,
only because those inventors found, ready to hand, a considerable number
of skilled mechanical workmen, placed at their disposal by the manufacturing
period. Some of these workmen were independent handicraftsman of various
trades, others were grouped together in manufactures, in which, as before-mentioned,
division of labour was strictly carried out. As inventions increased in
number, and the demand for the newly discovered machines grew larger, the
machine-making industry split up, more and more, into numerous independent
branches, and division of labour in these manufactures was more and more
developed. Here, then, we see in Manufacture the immediate technical foundation
of modern industry. Manufacture produced the machinery, by means of which
modern industry abolished the handicraft and manufacturing systems in those
spheres of production that it first seized upon. The factory system was
therefore raised, in the natural course of things, on an inadequate foundation.
When the system attained to a certain degree of development, it had to
root up this ready-made foundation, which in the meantime had been elaborated
on the old lines, and to build up for itself a basis that should correspond
to its methods of production. Just as the individual machine retains a
dwarfish character, so long as it is worked by the power of man alone,
and just as no system of machinery could be properly developed before the
steam-engine took the place of the earlier motive powers, animals, wind,
and even water; so, too, modern industry was crippled in its complete development,
so long as its characteristic instrument of production, the machine, owed
its existence to personal strength and personal skill, and depended on
the muscular development, the keenness of sight, and the cunning of hand,
with which the detail workmen in manufactures, arid the manual labourers
in handicrafts, wielded their dwarfish implements. Thus, apart from the
dearness of the machines made in this way, a circumstance that is ever
present to the mind of the capitalist, the expansion of industries carried
on by means of machinery, and the invasion by machinery of fresh branches
of production, were dependent on the growth of a class of workmen, who,
owing to the almost artistic nature of their employment, could increase
their numbers only gradually, and not by leaps and bounds. <a name="a18" class="calibre14" id="a18"></a>But besides
this, at a certain stage of its development, modern industry became technologically
incompatible with the basis furnished for it by handicraft and <!--362-->Manufacture.
The increasing size of the prime movers, of the transmitting mechanism,
and of the machines proper, the greater complication, multiformity and
regularity of the details of these machines, as they more and more departed
from the model of those originally made by manual labour, and acquired
a form, untrammelled except by the conditions under which they worked,
<sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n18" class="calibre1">[18]</a></sup> the perfecting of the automatic system, and the
use, every day more unavoidable, of a more refractory material, such as
iron instead of wood-the solution of all these problems, which sprang up
by the force of circumstances, everywhere met with a stumbling-block in
the personal restrictions, which even the collective labourer of Manufacture
could not break through, except to a limited extent. Such machines as the
modern hydraulic press, the modern power-loom, and the modern carding engine,
could never have been furnished by Manufacture.
</p>
<p class="title">A radical change in the mode of production in one sphere of industry
involves a similar change in other spheres. <a name="a19" class="calibre14" id="a19"></a>This happens at first in such
branches of industry as are connected together by being separate phases
of a process, and yet are isolated by the social division of labour, in
such a way, that each of them produces an independent commodity. Thus spinning
by machinery made weaving by machinery a necessity, and both together made
the mechanical and chemical revolution that took place in bleaching, printing,
and dyeing, imperative. So too, on the other hand, the revolution in cotton-spinning
called forth the invention of the gin, for separating the seeds from the
cotton fibre; it was only by means of this invention, that the production
of cotton became possible on the enormous scale at present required. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n19" class="calibre1">[19]</a></sup> But more especially, the revolution in the modes of production of industry and agriculture made necessary a revolution in the general conditions of
the social process of production, i.e., in the means of communication and
of transport. In a society whose pivot, to use an expression of Fourier,
was agriculture <!--363-->on a small scale, with its subsidiary domestic
industries, and the urban handicrafts, the means of communication and transport
were so utterly inadequate to the productive requirements of the manufacturing
period, with its extended division of social labour, its concentration
of the instruments of labour, and of the workmen, and its colonial markets,
that they became in fact revolutionised. In the same way the means of communication
and transport handed down from the manufacturing period soon became unbearable
trammels on modern industry, with its feverish haste of production, its
enormous extent, its constant flinging of capital and labour from one sphere
of production into another, and its newly-created connexions with the markets
of the whole world. Hence, apart from the radical changes introduced in
the construction of sailing vessels, the means of communication and transport
became gradually adapted to the modes of production of mechanical industry,
by the creation of a system of river steamers, railways, ocean steamers,
and telegraphs. But the huge masses of iron that had now to be forged,
to be welded, to be cut, to be bored, and to be shaped, demanded, on their
part, cyclopean machines, for the construction of which the methods of
the manufacturing period were utterly inadequate.
</p>
<p class="title">modern industry had therefore itself to take in hand the machine,
its characteristic instrument of production, and to construct machines
by machines. It was not till it did this, that it built up for itself a
fitting technical foundation, and stood on its own feet. Machinery, simultaneously
with the increasing use of it, in the first decades of this century, appropriated,
by degrees, the fabrication of machines proper. But it was only during
the decade preceding 1866, that the construction of railways and ocean
steamers on a stupendous scale called into existence the cyclopean machines
now employed in the construction of prime movers.

<a name="a20" class="calibre14" id="a20"></a></p>
<p class="title">The most essential condition to the production of machines by
machines was a prime mover capable of exerting any amount of force, and
yet under perfect control. Such a condition was already supplied by the
steam-engine. But at the same time it was necessary to produce the geometrically
accurate straight lines, planes, circles, cylinders, cones, and spheres,
required in the detail parts of the machines. This problem Henry Maudsley
solved in the first decade of this century by the invention of the slide
rest, a tool that was soon made automatic, and in a modified form was applied
to other constructive machines besides the lathe, for which it was originally
intended. This mechanical appliance replaces, not some particular tool,
but the hand itself, which produces a given form by holding and guiding
the cutting tool along the iron or other material operated upon. Thus it
became possible to produce the forms of the individual parts of machinery</p>
<p class="title"> “with a degree <!--364-->of ease, accuracy, and speed, that no accumulated
experience of the hand of the most skilled workman could give.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n20" class="calibre1">[20]</a></sup><a name="a21" class="calibre14" id="a21"></a>
<a name="a22" class="calibre14" id="a22"></a></p>

<p class="title">If we now fix our attention on that portion of the machinery employed
in the construction of machines, which constitutes the operating tool,
we find the manual implements re-appearing, but on a cyclopean scale. The
operating part of the boring machine is an immense drill driven by a steam-engine;
without this machine, on the other hand, the cylinders of large steam-engines
and of hydraulic presses could not be made. The mechanical lathe is only
a cyclopean reproduction of the ordinary foot-lathe; the planing machine,
an iron carpenter, that works on iron with the same tools that the human
carpenter employs on wood; the instrument that, on the London wharves,
cuts the veneers, is a gigantic razor; the tool of the shearing machine,
which shears iron as easily as a tailor’s scissors cut cloth, is a monster
pair of scissors; and the steam-hammer works with an ordinary hammer head,
but of such a weight that not Thor himself could wield it. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n21" class="calibre1">[21]</a></sup> These steam-hammers are an invention of Nasmyth, and there is one that weighs over 6 tons and strikes with a vertical fall of 7 feet, on an anvil
weighing 36 tons. It is mere child’s-play for it to crush a block of granite
into powder, yet it is no less capable of driving, with a succession of
light taps, a nail into a piece of soft wood. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n22" class="calibre1">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title">The implements of labour, in the form of machinery, necessitate
the substitution of natural forces for human force, and the conscious application
of science, instead of rule of thumb. In Manufacture, the organisation
of the social labour-process is purely subjective; it is a combination
of detail labourers; in its machinery system, modern industry has a productive
organism that is purely objective, in which the labourer becomes a mere
appendage to an already existing material condition of production. In simple
co-operation, and even in that founded on division of labour, the suppression
of the isolated, by the collective, workman still appears to be more or
less accidental. Machinery, with a few exceptions to be mentioned later,
operates only by means of associated <!--365-->labour, or labour in common.
Hence the co-operative character of the labour-process is, in the latter
case, a technical necessity dictated by the instrument of labour itself.

<hr class="end1"/><h3 id="calibre_toc_74" class="calibre17">SECTION 2 - THE VALUE TRANSFERRED BY MACHINERY TO THE PRODUCT</h3>

<hr class="end1"/><a name="a23" class="calibre14" id="a23"></a>
<p class="title">We saw that the productive forces resulting from co-operation
and division of labour cost capital nothing. They are natural forces of
social labour. So also physical forces, like steam, water, &amp;c., when
appropriated to productive processes, cost nothing. But just as a man requires
lungs to breathe with, so he requires something that is work of man’s hand,
in order to consume physical forces productively. A water-wheel is necessary
to exploit the force of water, and a steam-engine to exploit the elasticity
of steam. Once discovered, the law of the deviation of the magnetic needle
in the field of an electric current, or the law of the magnetisation of
iron, around which an electric current circulates, cost never a penny.
<sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n23" class="calibre1">[23]</a></sup> But the exploitation of these laws for the purposes of telegraphy, &amp;c., necessitates a costly and extensive apparatus.
The tool, as we have seen, is not exterminated by the machine. From being
a dwarf implement of the human organism, it expands and multiplies into
the implement of a mechanism created by man. Capital now sets the labourer
to work, not with a manual tool, but with a machine which itself handles
the tools. Although, therefore, it is clear at the first glance that, by
incorporating both stupendous physical forces, and the natural sciences,
with the process of production, modern industry raises the productiveness
of labour to an extraordinary degree, it is by no means equally clear,
that this increased productive force is not, on the other hand, purchased
by an increased expenditure of labour. Machinery, like every other component
of constant capital, creates no new value, but yields up its own value
to the product that it serves to beget. In so far as the machine has value,
and, in consequence, parts with value to the product, it forms an element
in the value of that product. Instead of being cheapened, the product is
made dearer in proportion to the value of the machine. And it is clear
as noon-day, that machines and systems of machinery, the characteristic
instruments of labour of Modern <!--366-->Industry, are incomparably more
loaded with value than the implements used in handicrafts and manufactures.
</p>
<p class="title">In the first place, it must be observed that the machinery, while
always entering as a whole into the labour-process, enters into the value-begetting
process only by bits. It never adds more value than it loses, on an average,
by wear and tear. Hence there is a great difference between the value of
a machine, and the value transferred in a given time by that machine to
the product. The longer the life of the machine in the labour-process,
the greater is that difference. It is true, no doubt, as we have already
seen, that every instrument of labour enters as a whole into the labour-process,
and only piece-meal, proportionally to its average daily loss by wear and
tear, into the value-begetting process. <a name="a24" class="calibre14" id="a24"></a>But this difference between the
instrument as a whole and its daily wear and tear, is much greater in a
machine than in a tool, because the machine, being made from more durable
material, has a longer life; because its employment, being regulated by
strictly scientific laws, allows of greater economy in the wear and tear
of its parts, and in the materials it consumes; and lastly, because its
field of production is incomparably larger than that of a tool. After making
allowance, both in the case of the machine and of the tool, for their average
daily cost, that is for the value they transmit to the product by their
average daily wear and tear, and for their consumption of auxiliary substance,
such as oil, coal, and so on, they each do their work gratuitously, just
like the forces furnished by Nature without the help of man. The greater
the productive power of the machinery compared with that of the tool, the
greater is the extent of its gratuitous service compared with that of the
tool. In modern industry man succeeded for the first time in making the
product of his past labour work on a large scale gratuitously, like the
forces of Nature. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n24" class="calibre1">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title">In treating of Co-operation and Manufacture, it was shown that
certain general factors of production, such as buildings, are, in comparison
with the scattered means of production of the isolated workman, economised
by being consumed in common, and that they therefore make the product cheaper.
In a system of machinery, not only is the framework of the machine consumed
in common by its numerous <!--367-->operating implements, but the prime
mover, together with a part of the transmitting mechanism, is consumed
in common by the numerous operative machines.

<a name="a25" class="calibre14" id="a25"></a></p>
<p class="title">Given the difference between the value of the machinery, and the
value transferred by it in a day to the product, the extent to which this
latter value makes the product dearer, depends in the first instance, upon
the size of the product; so to say, upon its area. Mr. Baynes, of Blackburn,
in a lecture published in 1858, estimates that</p>
<p class="title"> “each real mechanical horse-power
<sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n25" class="calibre1">[25]</a></sup> will drive 450 self-acting mule spindles, with
preparation, or 200 throstle spindles, or 15 looms for 40 inch cloth with
the appliances for warping, sizing, &amp;c.” </p>
<p class="title">In the first case, it is the day’s produce of 450 mule spindles, in the second, of 200 throstle spindles,
in the third, of 15 power-looms, over which the daily cost of one horse-power,
and the wear and tear of the machinery set in motion by that power, are
spread; so that only a very minute value is transferred by such wear and
tear to a pound of yarn or a yard of cloth. The same is the case with the
steam-hammer mentioned above. Since its daily wear and tear, its coal-consumption,
&amp;c., are spread over the stupendous masses of iron hammered by it in
a day, only a small value is added to a hundred weight of iron; but that
value would be very great, if the cyclopean instrument were employed in
driving in nails.
</p>
<p class="title">Given a machine’s capacity for work, that is, the number of its
operating tools, or, where it is a question of force, their mass, the amount
of its product will depend on the velocity of its working parts, on the
speed, for instance, of the spindles, or on the number of blows given by
the hammer in a minute. Many of these colossal hammers strike seventy <!--368-->times
in a minute, and Ryder’s patent machine for forging spindles with small
hammers gives as many as 700 strokes per minute.

<a name="a26" class="calibre14" id="a26"></a></p>
<p class="title">Given the rate at which machinery transfers its value to the product,
the amount of value so transferred depends on the total value of the machinery.
<sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n26" class="calibre1">[26]</a></sup> The less labour it contains, the less value it
imparts to the product. The less value it gives up, so much the more productive
it is, and so much the more its services approximate to those of natural
forces. But the production of machinery by machinery lessens its value
relatively to its extension and efficacy.

<a name="a27" class="calibre14" id="a27"></a></p>
<p class="title">An analysis and comparison of the prices of commodities produced
by handicrafts or manufactures, and of the prices of the same commodities
produced by machinery, shows generally, that, in the product of machinery,
the value due to the instruments of labour increases relatively, but decreases
absolutely. In other words, its absolute amount decreases, but its amount,
relatively to the total value of the product, of a pound of yarn, for instance,
increases. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n27" class="calibre1">[27]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title">It is evident that whenever it costs as much labour to produce
a machine as is saved by the employment of that machine, there is nothing
but a transposition of labour; consequently the total labour required to <!--369-->produce
a commodity is not lessened or the productiveness of labour is not increased.
It is clear, however, that the difference between the labour a machine
costs, and the labour it saves, in other words, that the degree of its
productiveness does not depend on the difference between its own value
and the value of the implement it replaces. As long as the labour spent
on a machine, and consequently the portion of its value added to the product,
remains smaller than the value added by the workman to the product with
his tool, there is always a difference of labour saved in favour of the
machine. The productiveness of a machine is therefore measured by the human
labour-power it replaces. <a name="a28" class="calibre14" id="a28"></a><a name="a29" class="calibre14" id="a29"></a><a name="a30" class="calibre14" id="a30"></a>According to Mr. Baynes, 2 operatives are required for the 450 mule spindles, inclusive of preparation machinery, <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n28" class="calibre1">[28]</a></sup> that are driven by one-horse power; each self-acting mule spindle, working ten hours, produces 13 ounces of yarn (average number of thickness); consequently 2½ operatives spin weekly 365 5/8 lbs. of yarn. Hence, leaving waste
on one side, 366 lbs. of cotton absorb, during their conversion into yarn,
only 150 hours’ labour, or fifteen days’ labour of ten hours each. But
with a spinning-wheel, supposing the hand-spinner to produce thirteen ounces
of yarn in sixty hours, the same weight of cotton would absorb 2,700 days’
labour of ten hours each, or 27,000 hours’ labour. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n29" class="calibre1">[29]</a></sup> Where blockprinting, the old method of printing calico by hand, has been superseded by machine printing, a single machine prints, with the aid of
one man or boy, as much calico of four colours in one hour, as it formerly
took 200 men to do. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n30" class="calibre1">[30]</a></sup> Before Eli Whitney invented
the cotton gin in 1793, the separation of the seed from a pound of cotton
cost an average day’s labour. <a name="a31" class="calibre14" id="a31"></a>By means of his invention one negress was
enabled to clean 100 lbs. daily; and since then, the efficacy of the gin
has been considerably increased. A pound of cotton wool, previously costing
50 cents to produce, included after that invention more unpaid labour,
and was consequently sold with greater profit, at 10 cents. In India they <!--370-->employ
for separating the wool from the seed, an instrument, half machine, half
tool, called a churka; with this one man and a woman can clean 28 lbs.
daily. With the churka invented some years ago by Dr. Forbes, one man and
a boy produce 250 lbs. daily. If oxen, steam, or water, be used for driving
it, only a few boys and girls as feeders are required. Sixteen of these
machines driven by oxen do as much work in a day as formerly 750 people
did on an average. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n31" class="calibre1">[31]</a></sup><a name="a32" class="calibre14" id="a32"></a></p>
<p class="title">As already stated, a steam-plough does as much work in one hour
at a cost of three-pence, as 66 men at a cost of 15 shillings. I return
to this example in order to clear up an erroneous notion. The 15 shillings
are by no means the expression in money of all the labour expended in one
hour by the 66 men. If the ratio of surplus-labour to necessary labour
were 100%, these 66 men would produce in one hour a value of 30 shillings,
although their wages, 15 shillings, represent only their labour for half
an hour. Suppose, then, a machine cost as much as the wages for a year
of the 150 men it displaces, say £3,000; this £3,000 is by
no means the expression in money of the labour added to the object produced
by these 150 men before the introduction of the machine, but only of that
portion of their year’s labour which was expended for themselves and represented
by their wages. On the other hand, the £3,000, the money-value of
the machine, expresses all the labour expended on its production, no matter
in what proportion this labour constitutes wages for the workman, and surplus-value
for the capitalist. Therefore, though a machine cost as much as the labour-power
displaced by it costs, yet the labour materialised in it is even then much
less than the living labour it replaces. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n32" class="calibre1">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title">The use of machinery for the exclusive purpose of cheapening the product,
is limited in this way, that less labour must be expended in producing
the machinery than is displaced by the employment of that machinery, For
the capitalist, however, this use is still more limited. Instead of paying
for the labour, he only pays the value of the labour-power employed; therefore,
the limit to his using a machine is fixed by the difference between the
value of the machine and the value of the labour-power replaced by it.
Since the division of the day’s work into necessary and surplus-labour
differs in different countries, and even in the same country at different
periods, or in different <a name="a33" class="calibre14" id="a33"></a>branches of industry; and further, since the actual
wage of the labourer at one time sinks below the value of his labour-power,
at another rises above it, it is possible for the difference between the
price of the machinery and the <!--371-->price of the labour-power replaced
by that machinery to vary very much, although the difference between the
quantity of labour requisite to produce the machine and the total quantity
replaced by it, remain constant. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n33" class="calibre1">[33]</a></sup> But it is the
former difference alone that determines the cost, to the capitalist, of
producing a commodity, and, through the pressure of competition, influences
his action. Hence the invention now-a-days of machines in England that
are employed only in North America; just as in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, machines were invented in Germany to be used only in Holland,
and just as many a French invention of the eighteenth century was exploited
in England alone. In the older countries, machinery, when employed in some
branches of industry, creates such a redundancy of labour in other branches
that in these latter the fall of wages below the value of labour-power
impedes the use of machinery, and, from the standpoint of the capitalist,
whose profit comes, not from a diminution of the labour employed, but of
the labour paid for, renders that use superfluous and often impossible.
In some branches of the woollen manufacture in <a name="a34" class="calibre14" id="a34"></a>England the employment of
children has during recent years been considerably diminished, and in some
cases has been entirely abolished. Why? Because the Factory Acts made two
sets of children necessary, one working six hours, the other four, or each
working five hours. But the parents refused to sell the “half-timers” cheaper
than the “full-timers.” <a name="a35" class="calibre14" id="a35"></a><a name="a36" class="calibre14" id="a36"></a><a name="a37" class="calibre14" id="a37"></a>Hence the substitution of machinery for the “half-timers.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n34" class="calibre1">[34]</a></sup> Before the labour of women and of children under 10 years of age was forbidden in mines, capitalists considered the employment of naked women and girls, often in company with men, so far sanctioned by their moral code, and especially by their ledgers, that it was only after the passing of the Act that they had recourse to machinery. The Yankees
have invented a stone-breaking machine. The English do not make use of
it, because the “wretch” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n35" class="calibre1">[35]</a></sup> who does this work gets paid for such a small portion of his labour, that machinery <!--372-->would
increase the cost of production to the capitalist. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n36" class="calibre1">[36]</a></sup> In England women are still occasionally used instead of horses for hauling canal boats, <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n37" class="calibre1">[37]</a></sup> because the labour required to produce horses and machines is an accurately known quantity, while that required
to maintain the women of the surplus-population is below all calculation.
Hence nowhere do we find a more shameful squandering of human labour-power
for the most despicable purposes than in England, the land of machinery.

<hr class="end1"/><p class="title">The starting-point of modern industry is, as we have
shown, the revolution in the instruments of labour, and this revolution
attains its most highly developed form in the organised system of machinery
in a factory. Before we inquire how human material is incorporated with
this objective organism, let us consider some general effects of this revolution
on the labourer himself.
</p>

<a name="S3a" class="calibre14" id="S3a"></a>

<h4 class="calibre15">A. Appropriation of Supplementary Labour-power by Capital. The Employment of Women and Children</h4>

<a name="a38" class="calibre14" id="a38"></a>
<p class="title">In so far as machinery dispenses with muscular power, it becomes a means
of employing labourers of slight muscular strength, and those whose bodily
development is incomplete, but whose limbs are all the more supple. The
labour of women and children was, therefore, the first thing sought for
by capitalists who used machinery. That mighty substitute for labour and
labourers was forthwith changed into a means for increasing the number
of wage-labourers by enrolling, under the direct sway of capital, every
member of the workman’s family, without distinction of age or sex. Compulsory
work for the capitalist usurped the place, not only of the children’s play,
but also of free labour at home within moderate limits for the support
of the family. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n38" class="calibre1">[38]</a></sup><a name="a39" class="calibre14" id="a39"></a></p>
<p class="title"><!--373-->The value of labour-power was determined, not only by the
labour-time necessary to maintain the individual adult labourer, but also
by that necessary to maintain his family. Machinery, by throwing every
member of that family on to the labour-market, spreads the value of the
man’s labour-power over his whole family. It thus depreciates his labour-power.
To purchase the labour-power of a family of four workers may, perhaps,
cost more than it formerly did to purchase the labour-power of the head
of the family, but, in return, four days’ labour takes the place of one,
and their price falls in proportion to the excess of the surplus-labour
of four over the surplus-labour of one. In order that the family may live,
four people must now, not only labour, but expend surplus-labour for the
capitalist. Thus we see, that machinery, while augmenting the human material
that forms the principal object of capital’s exploiting power, <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n39" class="calibre1">[39]</a></sup> at the same time raises the degree of exploitation.

<a name="a40" class="calibre14" id="a40"></a></p>
<p class="title">Machinery also revolutionises out and out the contract between
the labourer and the capitalist, which formally fixes their mutual relations.
Taking the exchange of commodities as our basis, our first assumption was
that capitalist and labourer met as free persons, as independent owners
of commodities; the one possessing money and means of production, the other
labour-power. But now the capitalist buys children and young persons under
age. Previously, the workman sold his own labour-power, which he disposed
of nominally as a free agent. Now he sells wife and child. He has become
a slave-dealer. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n40" class="calibre1">[40]</a></sup> The demand for <!--374-->children’s <a name="a41" class="calibre14" id="a41"></a>labour often resembles in form the inquiries for negro slaves, such as were formerly to be read among the advertisements in American journals.</p><p class="title">
</p><p class="title"> “My attention,” says an English factory inspector, “was drawn to an advertisement
in the local paper of one of the most important manufacturing towns of
my district, of which the following is a copy: Wanted, 12 to 20 young persons,
not younger than what can pass for 13 years. Wages, 4 shillings a week.
Apply &amp;c.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n41" class="calibre1">[41]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title">The phrase “what can pass for 13 years,” has reference to the fact, that by the Factory Act, children under
13 years may work only 6 hours. A surgeon officially appointed must certify
their age. The manufacturer, therefore, asks for children who look as if
they we’re already 13 years old. The decrease, often by leaps and bounds
in the number of children under 13 years employed in factories, a decrease
that is shown in an astonishing manner by the English statistics of the
last 20 years, was for the most part, according to the evidence of the
factory inspectors themselves, the work of the certifying surgeons, who
overstated the age of the children, agreeably to the capitalist’s greed
for exploitation, and the sordid trafficking needs of the parents. In the
notorious district of Bethnal Green, a public market is held every Monday
and Tuesday morning, where children of both sexes from 9 years of age upwards,
hire themselves out to the silk manufacturers. <a name="a42" class="calibre14" id="a42"></a><a name="a43" class="calibre14" id="a43"></a><a name="a44" class="calibre14" id="a44"></a>"The usual terms are 1s. 8d. a week (this belongs to the parents) and ‘2d. for myself and tea.’ The contract is binding only for the week. The scene and language while
this market is going on are quite disgraceful.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n42" class="calibre1">[42]</a></sup>
It has also occurred in England, that women have taken “children from the
workhouse and let any one have them out for 2s. 6d. a week.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n43" class="calibre1">[43]</a></sup> In spite of legislation, the number of boys sold in Great Britain by their parents to act as live chimney-sweeping machines (although there exist
plenty of machines to replace them) exceeds 2,000. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n44" class="calibre1">[44]</a></sup> The revolution effected by machinery in the juridical relations between the buyer and the seller of labour-power, causing the transaction as a
whole to lose the appearance of a contract <!--375-->between free persons,
afforded the English Parliament an excuse, founded on juridical principles,
for the interference of the state with factories. Whenever the law limits
the labour of children to 6 hours in industries not before interfered with,
the complaints of the manufacturers are always renewed. They allege that
numbers of the parents withdraw their children from the industry brought
under the Act, in order to sell them where “freedom of labour” still rules,
i.e., where children under 13 years are compelled to work like grown-up
people, and therefore can be got rid of at a higher price. But since capital
is by nature a leveller, since it exacts in every sphere of production
equality in the conditions of the exploitation of labour, the limitation
by law of children’s labour, in one branch of industry, becomes the cause
of its limitation in others.
</p>
<p class="title">We have already alluded to the physical deterioration as well
of the children and young-persons as of the women, whom machinery, first
directly in the factories that shoot up on its basis, and then indirectly
in all the remaining branches of industry, subjects to the exploitation
of capital. In this place, therefore, we dwell only on one point, the enormous
mortality, during the first few years of their life, of the children of
the operatives. In sixteen of the registration districts into which England
is divided, there are, for every 100,000 children alive under the age of
one year, only 9,000 deaths in a year on an average (in one district only
7,047); in 24 districts the deaths are over 10,000, but under 11,000; in
39 districts, over 11,000, but under 12,000; in 48 districts over 12,000,
but under 13,000; in 22 districts over 20,000; <a name="a45" class="calibre14" id="a45"></a>in 25 districts over 21,000;
in 17 over 22,000; in 11 over 23,000; in Hoo, Wolverhampton, Ashton-under-Lyne,
and Preston, over 24,000; in Nottingham, Stockport, and Bradford, over
25,000; in Wisbeach, 16,000; and in Manchester, 26,125. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n45" class="calibre1">[45]</a></sup> As was shown by an official medical inquiry in the year 1861, the high death-rates are, apart from local causes, principally due to the employment
of the mothers away from their homes, and to the neglect <a name="a46" class="calibre14" id="a46"></a><a name="a47" class="calibre14" id="a47"></a>and maltreatment, consequent on her absence, such as, amongst others, insufficient nourishment,
unsuitable food, and dosing with opiates; besides this, there arises an
unnatural estrangement between mother and child, and as a consequence intentional
starving and poisoning of the children. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n46" class="calibre1">[46]</a></sup> In those agricultural districts, “where a minimum in the employment of women exists,
the death-rate is on the other hand <!--376-->very low.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n47" class="calibre1">[47]</a></sup> The Inquiry Commission of 1861 led, however, to the unexpected result, that in some purely agricultural districts bordering on the North Sea,
the death-rate of children <a name="a48" class="calibre14" id="a48"></a>under one year old almost equalled that of the
worst factory districts. Dr. Julian Hunter was therefore commissioned to
investigate this phenomenon on the spot. His report is incorporated with
the “Sixth Report on Public Health.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n48" class="calibre1">[48]</a></sup> Up to that
time it was supposed, that the children <a name="a49" class="calibre14" id="a49"></a>were decimated by malaria, and
other diseases peculiar to low-lying and marshy districts. But the inquiry
showed the very opposite, namely, that the same cause which drove away
malaria, the conversion of the land, from a morass in winter and a scanty
pasture in summer, into fruitful corn land, created the exceptional death-rate
of the infants. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n49" class="calibre1">[49]</a></sup> The 70 medical men, whom Dr. Hunter examined in that district, were “wonderfully in accord” on this point.
In fact, the revolution in the mode of cultivation had led to the introduction
of the industrial system. </p>
<p class="title">Married women, who work in gangs along with boys
and girls, are, for a stipulated sum of money, placed at the disposal of
the farmer, by a man called the “undertaker,” who contracts for the whole
gang. “These gangs will sometimes travel many miles from their own village;
they are to be met morning and evening on the roads, <a name="a50" class="calibre14" id="a50"></a><a name="a51" class="calibre14" id="a51"></a><a name="a52" class="calibre14" id="a52"></a><a name="a53" class="calibre14" id="a53"></a>dressed in short petticoats, with suitable coats and boots, and sometimes trousers, looking wonderfully
strong and healthy, but tainted with a customary immorality and heedless
of the fatal results which their love of this busy and independent life
is bringing on their unfortunate offspring who are pining at home.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n50" class="calibre1">[50]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title">Every phenomenon of the factory districts is here reproduced, including, 
but to a greater extent, ill-disguised infanticide, and dosing children
with opiates. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n51" class="calibre1">[51]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title"> “My knowledge of such evils,” says Dr. Simon, the medical officer of the Privy Council and editor in chief
of the Reports on Public Health, “may excuse the profound misgiving with
which I regard any large industrial employment of adult women.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n52" class="calibre1">[52]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title"> “Happy indeed,” exclaims Mr. Baker, the factory inspector, in his official report, “happy indeed will it be for the manufacturing districts of England,
when every <!--377-->married woman having a family is prohibited from
working in any textile works at all.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n53" class="calibre1">[53]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title">The moral degradation caused by the capitalistic exploitation
of women and children has been so exhaustively depicted by F. Engels in
his “Lage der Arbeitenden Klasse Englands,” and other writers, that I need
only mention the subject in this place. But the intellectual desolation
artificially produced by converting immature human beings into mere machines
for the fabrication of surplus-value, a state of mind clearly distinguishable
from that natural ignorance which keeps the mind fallow without destroying
its capacity for development, its natural fertility, this desolation finally
compelled even the English Parliament to make elementary education a compulsory
condition to the “productive” employment of children under 14 years, in
every industry subject to the Factory Acts. The spirit of capitalist production
stands out clearly in the ludicrous wording of the so-called education
clauses in the Factory Acts, in the absence of an administrative machinery,
an absence that again makes the compulsion illusory, in the opposition
of the manufacturers themselves to these education clauses, and in the
tricks and dodges they put in practice for evading them.</p>
<p class="title"> “For this the legislature is alone to blame, by having passed a delusive law, which,
while it would seem to provide <a name="a54" class="calibre14" id="a54"></a>that the children employed in factories
shall be <em class="calibre11">educated, </em>contains no enactment by which that professed
end can be secured. It provides nothing more than that the children shall
on certain days of the week, and for a certain number of hours (three)
in each day, be inclosed within the four walls of a place called a school,
and that the employer of the child shall receive weekly a certificate to
that effect signed by a person designated by the subscriber as a schoolmaster
or schoolmistress.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n54" class="calibre1">[54]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title">Previous to the passing of the amended Factory Act, 1844, it happened, not unfrequently, that the
certificates of attendance at school were signed by the schoolmaster or
schoolmistress with a cross, as they themselves were unable to write.</p>
<p class="title"> “On one occasion, on visiting a place called a school, from which certificates
of school attendance, had issued, I was so struck with the ignorance of
the master, that I said to him: ‘Pray, sir, can you read?’ His reply was:
 ‘Aye, summat!’ and as a justification of his right to grant certificates,
he added: ‘At any rate, <a name="a55" class="calibre14" id="a55"></a>I am before my scholars.’” </p>
<p class="title">The inspectors, when the Bill of 1844 was in preparation, did not fail to represent the disgraceful
state of the places called schools, certificates from which they were obliged
to admit as a compliance with the laws, but they were successful only in
obtaining thus much, that since the passing of the Act of 1845, </p>
<p class="title">the figures in the <!--378-->school certificate must be filled up in the handwriting
of the schoolmaster, who must also sign his Christian and surname in full.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n55" class="calibre1">[55]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title">Sir John Kincaid, factory inspector for Scotland, relates experiences of the same kind.</p>
<p class="title"> “The first school we visited was
kept by a Mrs. Ann Killin. <a name="a56" class="calibre14" id="a56"></a>Upon asking her to spell her name, she straightway
made a mistake, by beginning with the letter C, but correcting herself
immediately, she said her name began with a K. On looking at her signature,
however, in the school certificate books, I noticed that she spelt it in
various ways, while her handwriting left no doubt as to her unfitness to
teach. She herself also acknowledged that she could not keep the register
... In a second school I found the schoolroom 15 feet long, and 10 feet
wide, and counted in this space 75 children, who were gobbling something
unintelligible” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n56" class="calibre1">[56]</a></sup> But it is not only in the miserable places above referred to that the children obtain certificates of school
attendance without having received instruction of any value, for in many
schools where there is a competent teacher, his efforts are of little avail
from the distracting crowd of children of all ages, from infants of 3 years
old and upwards; his livelihood, miserable at the best, depending on the
pence received from the greatest number of children whom it is possible
to cram into the space. <a name="a57" class="calibre14" id="a57"></a><a name="a58" class="calibre14" id="a58"></a>To this is to be added scanty school furniture, deficiency of books, and other materials for teaching, and the depressing
effect upon the poor children themselves of a close, noisome atmosphere.
I have been in many such schools, where I have seen rows of children doing
absolutely nothing; and this is certified as school attendance, and, in
statistical returns, such children are set down as being educated.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n57" class="calibre1">[57]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title">In Scotland the manufacturers try all they can to do without the children that are obliged to attend school.</p>
<p class="title"> “It requires no further argument to
prove that the educational clauses of the Factory Act, being held in such
disfavour among mill-owners, tend in a great measure to exclude that class
of children alike from the employment and the benefit of education contemplated
by this Act.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n58" class="calibre1">[58]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title">Horribly grotesque does this appear in print works, which are regulated by a special Act. By that Act,</p>
<p class="title"> “every child, before being employed in a print work must have attended school
for at least 30 days, and not less than 150 hours, during the six months
immediately preceding such first day of employment, and during the continuance
of its employment in the print works, it must attend for a like period
of 30 days, and 150 hours during every successive period of six months....
The attendance at school must be between 8 a.m. and <!--379-->6 p.m. No
attendance of less than 2½ hours, nor more than 5 hours on any one day,
shall be reckoned as part of the 150 hours. Under ordinary circumstances
the children attend school morning and afternoon for 30 days, for at least
5 hours each day, and upon the expiration of the 30 days, the statutory
total of 150 hours having been attained, having, in their language, made
up their book, they return to the print work, where they continue until
the six months have expired, when another instalment of school attendance
becomes due, and they again seek the school until the book is again made
up.... Many boys having attended school for the required number of hours,
when they return to school after the expiration of their six months’ work
in the print work, are in the same condition as when they first attended
school as print-work boys, that they have lost all they gained by their
previous school attendance.... In other print works the children’s attendance
at school is made to depend altogether upon the exigencies of the work
in the establishment. The requisite number of hours is made up each six
months, by instalments consisting of from 3 to 5 hours at a time, spreading
over, perhaps, the whole six months.... <a name="a59" class="calibre14" id="a59"></a>For instance, the attendance on
one day might be from 8 to 11 a.m., on another day from I p.m. to 4 p.m.,
and the child might not appear at school again for several days, when it
would attend from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m.; then it might attend for 3 or 4 days
consecutively, or for a week, then it would not appear in school for 3
weeks or a month, after that upon some odd days at some odd hours when
the operative who employed it chose to spare it; and thus the child was,
as it were, buffeted from school to work, from work to school, until the
tale of 150 hours was told.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n59" class="calibre1">[59]</a></sup><a name="a60" class="calibre14" id="a60"></a></p>

<p class="title">By the excessive addition of women and children to the ranks of
the workers, machinery at last breaks down the resistance which the male
operatives in the manufacturing period continued to oppose to the despotism
of capital. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n60" class="calibre1">[60]</a></sup></p>

<a name="S3b" class="calibre14" id="S3b"></a>

<h4 class="calibre15">B. Prolongation of the Working-Day</h4>

<p class="title">If machinery be the most powerful means for increasing the productiveness
of labour — i.e., for shortening the working-time required in the production
of a commodity, it becomes in the hands of capital the most powerful means,
in those industries first invaded by it, for lengthening the working-day
beyond all bounds set by human nature. It creates, on the one hand, new
conditions by which capital is enabled to give free scope to this its constant
tendency, and on the other hand, new motives with which to whet capital’s
appetite for the labour of others.

<a name="a61" class="calibre14" id="a61"></a>
<a name="a62" class="calibre14" id="a62"></a></p>
<p class="title">In the first place, in the form of machinery, the implements of
labour become automatic, things moving and working independent of the workman.
They are thenceforth an industrial <em class="calibre11">perpetuum mobile</em>, that would
go on producing forever, did it not meet with certain natural obstructions
in the weak bodies and the strong wills of its human attendants. The automaton,
as capital, and because it is capital, is endowed, in the person of the
capitalist, with intelligence and will; it is therefore animated by the
longing to reduce to a minimum the resistance offered by that repellent
yet elastic natural barrier, man. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n61" class="calibre1">[61]</a></sup> This resistance is moreover lessened by the apparent lightness of machine work, and by
the more pliant and docile character of the women and children employed
on it. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n62" class="calibre1">[62]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title">The productiveness of machinery is, as we saw, inversely proportional
to the value transferred by it to the product. The longer the life of the
machine, the greater is the mass of the products over which the value <!--381-->transmitted
by the machine is spread, and the less is the portion of that value added
to each single commodity. The active lifetime of a machine is, however,
clearly dependent on the length of the working-day, or on the duration
of the daily labour-process multiplied by the number of days for which
the process is carried on.
</p>
<p class="title">The wear and tear of a machine is not exactly proportional to
its working-time. And even if it were so, a machine working 16 hours daily
for 7½ years, covers as long a working period as, and transmits to the
total product no more value than, the same machine would if it worked only
8 hours daily for 15 years. But in the first case the value of the machine
would be reproduced twice as quickly as in the latter, and the capitalist
would, by this use of the machine, absorb in 7½ years as much surplus-value
as in the second case he would in 15.

<a name="a63" class="calibre14" id="a63"></a></p>
<p class="title">The material wear and tear of a machine is of two kinds. The one
arises from use, as coins wear away by circulating, the other from non-use,
as a sword rusts when left in its scabbard. The latter kind is due to the
elements. The former is more or less directly proportional, the latter
to a certain extent inversely proportional, to the use of the machine.
<sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n63" class="calibre1">[63]</a></sup><a name="a64" class="calibre14" id="a64"></a>
<a name="a65" class="calibre14" id="a65"></a>
<a name="a66" class="calibre14" id="a66"></a></p>
<p class="title">But in addition to the material wear and tear, a machine also
undergoes, what we may call a moral depreciation. It loses exchange-value,
either by machines of the same sort being produced cheaper than it, or
by better machines entering into competition with it. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n64" class="calibre1">[64]</a></sup> In both cases, be the machine ever so young and full of life, its value is no longer determined by the labour actually materialised in it, but
by the labour-time requisite to reproduce either it or the better machine.
It has, therefore, lost value more or less. The shorter the period taken
to reproduce its total value, the less is the danger of moral depreciation;
and the longer the working-day, the shorter is that period. When machinery
is first introduced into an industry, new methods of reproducing it more
cheaply follow blow upon blow, <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n65" class="calibre1">[65]</a></sup> and so do improvements, that not only affect <!--382-->individual parts and details of the machine,
but its entire build. It is, therefore, in the early days of the life of
machinery that this special incentive to the prolongation of the working-day
makes itself felt most acutely. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n66" class="calibre1">[66]</a></sup><a name="a67" class="calibre14" id="a67"></a>
<a name="a68" class="calibre14" id="a68"></a></p>
<p class="title">Given the length of the working-day, all other circumstances remaining
the same, the exploitation of double the number of workmen demands, not
only a doubling of that part of constant capital which is invested in machinery
and buildings, but also of that part which is laid out in raw material
and auxiliary substances. The lengthening of the working-day, on the other
hand, allows of production on an extended scale without any alteration
in the amount of capital laid out on machinery and buildings. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n67" class="calibre1">[67]</a></sup> Not only is there, therefore, an increase of surplus-value, but the outlay necessary to obtain it diminishes. <a name="a69" class="calibre14" id="a69"></a>It is true that this takes place, more or less, with every lengthening of the working-day; but in the case under
consideration, the change is more marked, because the capital converted
into the instruments of labour preponderates to a greater degree. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n68" class="calibre1">[68]</a></sup> The development of the factory system fixes a constantly increasing portion of the capital in a form, in which, on the one hand, its value is capable
of continual self-expansion, and in which, on the other hand, it loses
both use-value and exchange-value whenever it loses contact with living
labour. “When a labourer,” said <a name="a70" class="calibre14" id="a70"></a>Mr. Ashworth, a cotton magnate, to Professor
Nassau W. Senior, “lays down his spade, he renders useless, for that period,
a capital worth eighteen-pence. When one of our people leaves the mill,
he renders useless a capital that has cost £100,000.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n69" class="calibre1">[69]</a></sup> Only fancy! making “useless” for a single moment, a capital that has cost £100,000! It is, in truth, monstrous, that a single one of our people
should ever leave the factory! The increased use of machinery, as Senior
after the instruction he re<!--383-->ceived from Ashworth clearly perceives,
makes a constantly increasing lengthening of the working-day “desirable.” 
 <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n70" class="calibre1">[70]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title">Machinery produces relative surplus-value; not only by directly
depreciating the value of labour-power, and by indirectly cheapening the
same through cheapening the commodities that enter into its reproduction,
but also, when it is first introduced sporadically into an industry, by
converting the labour employed by the owner of that machinery, into labour
of a higher degree and greater efficacy, by raising the social value of
the article produced above its individual value, and thus enabling the
capitalist to replace the value of a day’s labour-power by a smaller portion
of the value of a day’s product. During this transition period, when the
use of machinery is a sort of monopoly, the profits are therefore exceptional,
and the capitalist endeavours to exploit thoroughly “the sunny time of
this his first love,” by prolonging the working-day as much as possible.
The magnitude of the profit whets his appetite for more profit.
</p>
<p class="title">As the use of machinery becomes more general in a particular industry,
the social value of the product sinks down to its individual value, and
the law that surplus-value does not arise from the labour-power that has
been replaced by the machinery, but from the labour-power actually employed
in working with the machinery, asserts itself. Surplus-value arises from
variable capital alone, and we saw that the amount of surplus-value depends
on two factors, viz., the rate of surplus-value and the number of the workmen
simultaneously employed. Given the length of the working-day, the rate
of surplus-value is determined by the relative duration of the necessary
labour and of the surplus-labour in a day. The number of the labourers
simultaneously employed depends, on its side, on the ratio of the variable
to the constant capital. Now, however much the use of machinery may increase
the surplus-labour at the expense of the necessary labour by heightening
the productiveness of labour, it is clear that it attains this result,
only by diminishing the number of workmen employed by a given amount of
capital. It converts what was formerly variable capital, invested in labour-power,
into machinery which, being constant capital, does not produce surplus-<!--384-->value.
It is impossible, for instance, to squeeze as much surplus-value out of
2 as out of 24 labourers. If each of these 24 men gives only one hour of
surplus-labour in 12, the 24 men give together 24 hours of surplus-labour,
while 24 hours is the total labour of the two men. Hence, the application
of machinery to the production of surplus-value implies a contradiction
which is immanent in it, since of the two factors of the surplus-value
created by a given amount of capital, <a name="a71" class="calibre14" id="a71"></a>one, the rate of surplus-value, cannot
be increased, except by diminishing the other, the number of workmen. This
contradiction comes to light, as soon as by the general employment of machinery
in a given industry, the value of the machine-produced commodity regulates
the value of all commodities of the same sort; and it is this contradiction,
that in its turn, drives the capitalist, without his being conscious of
the fact, <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n71" class="calibre1">[71]</a></sup> to excessive lengthening of the working-day, in order that he may compensate the decrease in the relative number of
labourers exploited, by an increase not only of the relative, but of the
absolute surplus-labour.

<a name="a72" class="calibre14" id="a72"></a></p>
<p class="title">If, then, the capitalistic employment of machinery, on the one
hand, supplies new and powerful motives to an excessive lengthening of
the working-day, and radically changes, as well the methods of labour,
as also the character of the social working organism, in such a manner
as to break down all opposition to this tendency, on the other hand it
produces, partly by opening out to the capitalist new strata of the working-class,
previously inaccessible to him, partly by setting free the labourers it
supplants, a surplus working population, <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n72" class="calibre1">[72]</a></sup> which
is compelled to submit to the dictation of capital. Hence that remarkable
phenomenon in the history of modern industry, that machinery sweeps away
every moral and natural restriction on the length of the working-day. Hence,
too, the economic paradox, that the most powerful instrument for shortening
labour-time, becomes the most unfailing means for placing every moment
of the labourer’s <a name="a73" class="calibre14" id="a73"></a>time and that of his family, at the disposal of the capitalist for the purpose of expanding the value of his capital. “If,” dreamed Aristotle,
the greatest thinker of antiquity, “if every tool, when summoned, or even
of its own accord, could do the work that befits it, just as the creations
of Daedalus moved of themselves, or the tripods of Hephaestos went of their
own accord to their sacred work, if the weavers’ shuttles were to weave
of themselves, <a name="a74" class="calibre14" id="a74"></a>then there would be no need either of apprentices for the
master workers, or of slaves for <!--385-->the lords.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n73" class="calibre1">[73]</a></sup> And Antipatros, a Greek poet of the time of Cicero, hailed the invention of the water-wheel for grinding corn, an invention that is the elementary
form of all machinery, as the giver of freedom to female slaves, and the
bringer back of the golden age. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n74" class="calibre1">[74]</a></sup> Oh! those heathens! They understood, as the learned Bastiat, and before him the still wiser
MacCulloch have discovered, nothing of Political Economy and Christianity.
They did not, for example, comprehend that machinery is the surest means
of lengthening the working-day. They perhaps excused the slavery of one
on the ground that it was a means to the full development of another. But
to preach slavery of the masses, in order that a few crude and half-educated
parvenus, might become “eminent spinners,” “extensive sausage-makers,” 
 and “influential shoe-black dealers,” to do this, they lacked the bump
of Christianity.

<h4 class="calibre15">C. Intensification of Labour</h4>

<p class="title">The immoderate lengthening of the working-day, produced by machinery
in the hands of capital, leads to a reaction on the part of society, the
very sources of whose life are menaced; and, thence, to a normal working-day
whose length is fixed by law. Thenceforth a phenomenon. that we have already
met with, namely, the intensification of labour, develops into great importance.
Our analysis of absolute surplus-value had reference primarily to the extension
or duration of the labour, its intensity being assumed as given. We now
proceed to consider the substitution of a more intensified labour for labour
of more extensive duration, and the degree of the former.
</p>
<p class="title">It is self-evident, that in proportion as the use of machinery
spreads, and the experience of a special class of workmen habituated to
machinery accumulates, the rapidity and intensity of labour increase as
a natural consequence. Thus in England, during half a century, lengthening
of the working-day went hand in hand with increasing intensity of factory
labour. Nevertheless the reader will clearly see, that where we have labour,
not carried on by fits and starts, but repeated day after day with unvarying
uniformity, a point must inevitably be reached, where extension of the
working-day and intensity of the labour mutually exclude one another, in
such a way that lengthening of the working-day becomes compatible only
with a lower degree of intensity, and a higher degree of intensity, only
with a shortening of the working-day. So soon as the gradually surging
revolt of the working-class compelled Parliament to shorten compulsorily
the hours of labour, and to begin by imposing a normal working-day on factories
proper, so soon consequently as an increased production of surplus-value
by the prolongation of the working-day was once for all put a stop to,
from that moment capital threw itself with all its might into the production
of relative surplus-value, by hastening on the further improvement of machinery.
At the same time a change took place in the nature of relative surplus-value.
Generally speaking, the mode of producing relative surplus-value consists
in raising the productive power of the workman, so as to enable him to
produce more in a given time with the same expenditure of labour. Labour-time
continues to transmit as before the same value to the total product, but
this unchanged amount of exchange-value is spread over more use-value;
hence the value of each single commodity sinks. Otherwise, however, so
soon as the compulsory shortening of the hours of labour takes place. The
immense impetus it gives the development of productive power, and to economy
in the means of production, imposes on the workman increased expenditure
of labour in a given time, heightened <a name="a75" class="calibre14" id="a75"></a>tension of labour-power, and closer
filling up of the pores of the working-day, or condensation of labour to
a degree that is attainable only within the limits of the shortened working-day.
This condensation of a greater mass of labour into a given period thenceforward
counts for what it really is, a greater quantity of labour. In addition
to a measure of its extension, i.e., duration, labour now acquires a measure
of its intensity or of the degree of its condensation or density. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n75" class="calibre1">[75]</a></sup><!--387-->The denser hour of the ten hours’ working-day contains more labour, i.e., expended labour-power. than the more porous hour of the twelve hours’ working-day. The product therefore of one of the former hours has as much or more value
than has the product of 1 1/5 of the latter hours. Apart from the increased
yield of relative surplus-value through the heightened productiveness of
labour, the same mass of value is now produced for the capitalist say by
3 1/3 hours of surplus-labour, and 6 2/3 hours of necessary labour, as
was previously produced by four hours of surplus-labour and eight hours
of necessary labour.
</p>
<p class="title">We now come to the question: How is the labour intensified?

<a name="a76" class="calibre14" id="a76"></a>
<a name="a77" class="calibre14" id="a77"></a></p>
<p class="title">The first effect of shortening the working-day results from the
self-evident law, that the efficiency of labour-power is in an inverse
ratio to the duration of its expenditure. Hence, within certain limits
what is lost by shortening the duration is gained by the increasing tension
of labour-power. That the workman moreover really does expend more labour-power,
is ensured by the mode in which the capitalist pays him. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n76" class="calibre1">[76]</a></sup> In those industries, such as potteries, where machinery plays little or no part, the introduction of the Factory Acts has strikingly shown that
the mere shortening of the working-day increases to a wonderful degree
the regularity, uniformity, order, continuity, and energy of the labour.
<sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n77" class="calibre1">[77]</a></sup> It seemed, however, doubtful whether this effect was produced in the factory proper, where the dependence of the workman
on the continuous and uniform motion of the machinery had already created
the <a name="a78" class="calibre14" id="a78"></a>strictest discipline. Hence, when in 1844 the reduction of the working-day
to less than twelve hours was being debated, the masters almost unanimously
declared</p>
<p class="title"> “that their overlookers in the different rooms took good care
that the hands lost no time,” <a name="a79" class="calibre14" id="a79"></a>that “the extent of vigilance and attention
on the part of the workmen was hardly capable of being increased,” and,
therefore, that the speed of the machinery and other conditions remaining
unaltered, “to expect in a well-managed factory any important result from
increased attention of the workmen was an absurdity.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n78" class="calibre1">[78]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title">This assertion was contradicted by experiments. 
Mr. Robert Gardner reduced the hours of labour in his two large factories at Preston, on and after
the 20th April, 1844, from twelve to eleven hours a day. The result of
about a year’s working was that “the same amount of product for the same
cost was <a name="a80" class="calibre14" id="a80"></a>received, and the workpeople as a <!--388-->whole earned in eleven
hours as much wages as they did before in twelve.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n79" class="calibre1">[79]</a></sup> I pass over the experiments made in the spinning and carding rooms, because they were accompanied by an increase of 2% in the speed of the machines.
But in the weaving department, where, moreover, many sorts of figured fancy
articles were woven, there was not the slightest alteration in the conditions
of the work. <a name="a81" class="calibre14" id="a81"></a>The result was: “From 6th January to 20th April, 1844, with
a twelve hours’ day, average weekly wages of each hand 10s. 1½d., from
20th April to 29th June, 1844, with day of eleven hours, average weekly
wages 10s. 3½d.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n80" class="calibre1">[80]</a></sup> Here we have more produced
in eleven hours than previously in twelve, and entirely in consequence
of more steady application and economy of time by the workpeople. While
they got the same wages and gained one hour of spare time, the capitalist
got the same amount produced and saved the cost of coal, gas, and other
such items, for one hour. Similar experiments, and with the like success,
were carried out in the mills of Messrs. Horrocks and Jacson. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n81" class="calibre1">[81]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title">The shortening of the hours of labour creates, to begin with,
the subjective conditions for the condensation of labour, by enabling the
workman to exert more strength in a given time. So soon as that shortening
becomes compulsory, machinery becomes in the hands of capital the objective
means, systematically employed for squeezing out more labour in a given
time. This is effected in two ways: by increasing the speed of the machinery,
and by giving the workman more machinery to tent. Improved construction
of the machinery is necessary, partly because without it greater pressure
cannot be put on the workman, and partly because the shortened hours of
labour force the capitalist to exercise the strictest watch over the cost
of production. The improvements in the steam-engine have increased the
piston speed, and at the same time have made it possible, by means of a
greater economy of power, to drive with the same or even a smaller consumption
of coal more machinery with the same engine. The improvements in the transmitting
mechanism have lessened friction, and, what so strikingly distinguishes
modern from the older machinery, have reduced the diameter and weight of
the shafting to a constantly decreasing minimum. Finally, <!--389-->the
improvements in the operative machines have, while reducing their size,
increased their speed and efficiency, as in the modern power-loom; or,
while increasing the size of their framework, have also increased the extent
and number of their working parts, as in spinning-mules, or have added
to the speed of these working parts by imperceptible alterations of detail,
such as those which ten years ago increased the speed of the spindles in
self-acting mules by one-fifth.

<a name="a82" class="calibre14" id="a82"></a></p>
<p class="title">The reduction of the working-day to 12 hours dates in England
from 1832. In 1836 a manufacturer stated:</p>
<p class="title"> “The labour now undergone in
the factories is much greater than it used to be ... compared with thirty
or forty years ago ... owing to the greater attention and activity required
by the greatly increased speed which is given to the machinery.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n82" class="calibre1">[82]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title">In the year 1844, Lord Ashley, now Lord Shaftesbury, made in the House of Commons the following statements, supported by documentary evidence:</p>
<p class="title"> “The labour performed by those engaged in the processes of manufacture,
is three times as great as in the beginning of such operations. Machinery
has executed, no doubt, the work that would demand the sinews of millions
of men; but it has also prodigiously multiplied the labour of those. who
are governed by its fearful movements.... In 1815, the labour of following
a pair of mules spinning cotton of No. 40 — reckoning 12 hours to the
working-day — involved a necessity of walking 8 miles. In 1832, the distance
travelled in following a pair of mules, spinning cotton yarn of the same
number, was 20 miles, and frequently more. In 1835” (query — 1815 or 1825?)
 “the spinner put up daily, on each of these mules, 820 stretches, making
a total of 1,640 stretches in the course of the day. In 1832, the spinner
put up on each mule 2,200 stretches, making a total of 4,400. In 1844,
2,400 stretches, making a total of 4,800; and in some cases the amount
of labour required is even still greater.... I have another document sent
to me in 1842, stating that the labour is progressively increasing-increasing
not only because the distance to be travelled is greater, <a name="a83" class="calibre14" id="a83"></a>but because the
quantity of goods produced is multiplied, while the hands are fewer in
proportion than before; and, moreover, because an inferior species of cotton
is now often spun, which it is more difficult to work.... In the carding-room
there has also been a great increase of labour. One person there does the
work formerly divided between two. In the weaving-room, where a vast number
of persons are employed, and principally females ... the labour has increased
within the last few years fully 10 per cent., owing to the increased speed
of the machinery in spinning. In 1838, the number of hanks spun per week
was 18,000, in 1843 it amounted to 21,000. In 1819, <!--390-->the number
of picks in power-loom-weaving per minute was 60 — in 1842 it was 140,
showing a vast increase of labour.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n83" class="calibre1">[83]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title">In the face of this remarkable intensity of labour which had already
been reached in 1844 under the Twelve Hours’ Act, there appeared to be
a justification for the assertion made at that time by the English manufacturers,
that any further progress in that direction was impossible, and therefore
that every further reduction of the hours of labour meant a lessened production.
The apparent correctness of their reasons will be best shown by the following
contemporary statement by Leonard Horner, the factory inspector, their
ever watchful censor.</p>
<p class="title"> “Now, as the quantity produced must, in the main, be regulated
by the speed of the machinery, it must be the interest of the mill-owner
to drive it at the utmost rate of speed consistent with these following
conditions, viz., the preservation of the machinery from too rapid deterioration;
the preservation of the quality of the article manufactured; and the capability
of the workman to follow the motion without a greater exertion than he
can sustain for a constancy. One of the most important problems, therefore,
which the owner of a factory has to solve is to find out the maximum speed
at which he can run, with a due regard to the above conditions. It frequently
happens that he finds he has gone too fast, that breakages and bad work
more than counterbalance the increased speed, <a name="a84" class="calibre14" id="a84"></a><a name="a85" class="calibre14" id="a85"></a>and that he is obliged to slacken his pace. I therefore concluded, that as an active and intelligent
mill-owner would find out the safe maximum, it would not be possible to
produce as much in eleven hours as in twelve. I further assumed that the
operative paid by piecework, would exert himself to the utmost consistent
with the power of continuing at the same rate.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n84" class="calibre1">[84]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title"> Horner, therefore, came to the conclusion that a reduction of the working hours below twelve would necessarily diminish production? <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n85" class="calibre1">[85]</a></sup> He himself, ten years later, cites his opinion of 1845 in proof of how much he under-estimated in that year the elasticity of machinery, and of
man’s labour-power, both of which are simultaneously stretched to an extreme
by the compulsory shortening of the working-day.
</p>
<p class="title">We now come to the period that follows the introduction of the
Ten Hours’ Act in 1847 into the English cotton, woollen, silk, and flax
mills.
<a name="a86" class="calibre14" id="a86"></a>
<a name="a87" class="calibre14" id="a87"></a></p>

<p class="title"> “The speed of the spindles has increased upon throstles 500, and
upon mules 1,000 revolutions a minute, i.e., the speed of the throstle
spindle, which in 1839 was 4,500 times a minute, is now (1862) 5,000; and
of the mule spindle, that was 5,000, is now 6,000 times a minute, <!--391-->amounting
in the former case to one-tenth, and in the second case to one-fifth additional
increase.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n86" class="calibre1">[86]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title">James Nasmyth, the eminent civil engineer of Patricroft, near Manchester, explained in a letter to Leonard Horner,
written in 1852, the nature of the improvements in the steam-engine that
had been made between the years 1848 and 1852. After remarking that the
horse-power of steam-engines, being always estimated in the official returns
according to the power of similar engines in 1828, <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n87" class="calibre1">[87]</a></sup> is only nominal, and can serve only as an index of their real power, he goes on to say:</p>
<p class="title"> “I am confident that from the same weight of steam-engine
machinery, we are now obtaining at least 50 per cent. more duty or work
performed on the average, and that in many cases the identical steam-engines
which in the days of the restricted speed of 220 feet per minute, yielded
50 horsepower, are now yielding upwards of 100...” <a name="a88" class="calibre14" id="a88"></a><a name="a89" class="calibre14" id="a89"></a>"The modern steam-engine of 100 horse-power is capable of being driven at a much greater force than
formerly, arising from improvements in its construction, the capacity and
construction of the boilers, &amp;c....” “Although the same number of hands
are employed in proportion to the horse-power as at former periods, there
are fewer hands employed in proportion to the machinery.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n88" class="calibre1">[88]</a></sup> “In the year 1850, the factories of the United Kingdom employed 134,217 nominal horse-power to give motion to 25,638,716 spindles and 301,445 looms.
The number of spindles and looms in 1856 was respectively 33,503,580 of
the former, and 369,205 of the latter, which, reckoning the force of the
nominal horse-power required to be the same as in 1850, would require a
force equal to 175,000 horses, but the actual power given in the return
for 1856 is 161,435, less by above 10,000 horses than, calculating upon
the basis of the return of 1850, the factories ought to have required in
1856.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n89" class="calibre1">[89]</a></sup> “The facts thus brought out by the Return (of 1856) appear to be that the factory system is increasing rapidly; that
although the same <a name="a90" class="calibre14" id="a90"></a>number of hands are employed in proportion to the horse-power
as at former periods, there are fewer hands employed in proportion to the
machinery; that the steam-engine is enabled to drive an increased weight
of machinery by economy of force and other methods, and that an increased
quantity of work can <!--392-->be turned off by improvements in machinery,
and in methods of manufacture, by increase of speed of the machinery, and
by a variety of other causes.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n90" class="calibre1">[90]</a></sup><a name="a91" class="calibre14" id="a91"></a></p>

<p class="title"> “The great improvements made in machines of every kind have raised their
productive power very much. Without any doubt, the shortening of the hours
of labour... gave the impulse to these improvements. The latter, combined
with the more intense strain on the workman, have had the effect, that
at least as much is produced in the shortened (by two hours or one-sixth)
working-day as was previously produced during the longer one.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n91" class="calibre1">[91]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title">One fact is sufficient to show how greatly the wealth of the manufacturers
increased along with the more intense exploitation of labour-power. From
1838 to 1850, the average proportional increase in English cotton and other
factories was 32%, while from 1850 to 1856 it amounted to 86%.
</p>
<p class="title">But however great the progress of English industry had been during
the 8 years from 1848 to 1856 under the influence of a working-day of 10
hours, it wag far surpassed during the next period of 6 years from 1856
to 1862. In silk factories, for instance, there were in 1856, spindles
1,093,799; in 1862, 1,388,544; in 1856, looms 9,260; in 1862, 10,709. But
the number of operatives was, in 1856, 56,131; in 1862, 52,429. The increase
in the spindles was therefore 26.9% and in the looms 15.6%, while the number
of the operatives decreased 7%. In the year 1850 there were employed in
worsted mills 875,830 spindles; in 1856, 1,324,549 (increase 51.2%), and
in 1862, 1,289,172 (decrease 2.7%). But if we deduct the doubling spindles
that figure in the numbers for 1856, <a name="a92" class="calibre14" id="a92"></a>but not in those for 1862, it will
be found that after 1856 the number of spindles remained nearly stationary.
On the other hand, after 1850, the speed of the spindles and looms was
in many cases doubled. The number of power-looms in worsted mills was,
in 1850, 32,617; in 1856, 38,956; in 1862, 43,048. The number of the operatives
was, in 1850, 79,737; in 1856, 87,794; in 1862, 86,063; included in these,
however, the children under 14 years of age were, in 1850, 9,956; in 1856,
11,228; in 1862, 13,178. In spite, therefore, of the greatly increased
number of looms in 1862, compared with 1856, the total number of the workpeople
employed decreased, and that of the children exploited increased. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n92" class="calibre1">[92]</a></sup><a name="a93" class="calibre14" id="a93"></a></p>
<p class="title">On the 27th April, 1863, Mr. Ferrand said in the House of Commons:</p>
<p class="title"> “I have been informed by delegates from 16 districts of Lancashire and
Cheshire, in whose behalf I speak, that the work in the factories is, in <!--393-->consequence
of the improvements in machinery, constantly on the increase. Instead of
as formerly one person with two helps tenting two looms, one person now
tents three looms without helps, and it is no uncommon thing for one person
to tent four. Twelve hours’ work, as is evident from the facts adduced,
is now compressed into less than 10 hours. It is therefore self-evident,
to what an enormous extent the toil of the factory operative has increased
during the last 10 years.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n93" class="calibre1">[93]</a></sup><a name="a94" class="calibre14" id="a94"></a>
<a name="a95" class="calibre14" id="a95"></a></p>

<p class="title">Although, therefore, the Factory Inspectors unceasingly and with
justice, commend the results of the Acts of 1844 and 1850, yet they admit
that the shortening of the hours of labour has already called forth such
an intensification of the labour as is injurious to the health of the workman
and to his capacity for work.</p>
<p class="title"> “In most of the cotton, worsted, and silk
mills, an exhausting state of excitement necessary to enable the workers
satisfactorily to mind the machinery, the motion of which has been greatly
accelerated within the last few years, seems to me not unlikely to be one
of the causes of that excess of mortality from lung disease, which Dr.
Greenhow has pointed out in his recent report on this subject.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n94" class="calibre1">[94]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title">There cannot be the slightest doubt that the tendency that urges capital, so soon as a prolongation of the hours of labour is once for all forbidden,
to compensate itself, by a systematic heightening of the intensity of labour,
and to convert every improvement in machinery into a more perfect means
of exhausting the workman, must soon lead to <a name="a96" class="calibre14" id="a96"></a>a state of things in which
a reduction of the hours of labour will again be inevitable. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n95" class="calibre1">[95]</a></sup> On the other hand, the rapid advance of English industry between 1848 and the present time, under the influence of a day of 10 hours, surpasses the
advance made between 1833 and 1847, when the day was 12 hours long, by
far more than the latter surpasses the advance made during the half century
after the first introduction of the factory system, when the working-day
was without limits. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n96" class="calibre1">[96]</a></sup></p>

<hr class="end1"/><h3 id="calibre_toc_76" class="calibre17">SECTION 4 - THE FACTORY</h3>

<hr class="end1"/><p class="title">At the commencement of this chapter we considered
that which we may call the body of the factory, i.e., machinery organised
into a system. We there saw how machinery, by annexing the labour of women
and children, augments the number of human beings who form the material
for capitalistic exploitation, how it confiscates the whole of the workman’s
disposable time, by immoderate extension of the hours of labour, and how
finally its progress, which allows of enormous increase of production in
shorter and shorter periods, serves as a means of systematically getting
more work done in a shorter time, or of exploiting labour-power more intensely.
We now turn to the factory as a whole, and that in its most perfect form.
</p>
<p class="title">Dr. Ure, the Pindar of the automatic factory, describes it, on
the one hand, as</p>
<p class="title"> “Combined co-operation of many orders of workpeople, adult <!--395-->
and young, in tending with assiduous skill, a system of productive machines,
continuously impelled by a central power” (the prime mover); on the other
hand, as “a vast automaton, composed of various mechanical and intellectual
organs, acting in uninterrupted concert for the production of a common
object, all of them being subordinate to a self-regulated moving force.” </p>
<p class="title">These two descriptions are far from being identical. In one, the collective
labourer, or social body of labour, appears as the dominant 
subject, and the mechanical automaton as the object; in the other, the automaton itself
is the subject, and the workmen are merely conscious <a name="a97" class="calibre14" id="a97"></a>organs, co-ordinate
with the unconscious organs of the automaton, and together with them, subordinated
to the central<!--396--> moving-power. The first description is applicable
to every possible employment of machinery on a large scale, the second
is characteristic of its use by capital, and therefore of the modern factory
system. Ure prefers therefore, to describe the central machine, from which
the motion comes, not only as an automaton, but as an autocrat. “In these
spacious halls the benignant power of steam summons around him his myriads
of willing menials.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n97" class="calibre1">[97]</a></sup><a name="a98" class="calibre14" id="a98"></a></p>
<p class="title">Along with the tool, the skill of the workman in handling it passes
over to the machine. The capabilities of the tool are emancipated from
the restraints that are inseparable from human labour-power. Thereby the
technical foundation on which is based the division of labour in Manufacture,
is swept away. Hence, in the place of the hierarchy of specialised workmen
that characterises manufacture, there steps, in the automatic factory,
a tendency to equalise and reduce to one and the same level every kind
of work that has to be done by the minders of the machines; <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n98" class="calibre1">[98]</a></sup> in the place of the artificially produced differentiations of the detail workmen, step the natural differences of age and sex.
</p>
<p class="title">So far as division of labour re-appears in the factory, it is
primarily a distribution of the workmen among the specialised machines;
and of masses of workmen, not however organised into groups, among the
various departments of the factory, in each of which they work at a number
of similar machines placed together; their co-operation, therefore, is
only simple. The organised group, peculiar to manufacture, is replaced
by the connexion between the head workman and his few assistants. The essential
division is, into workmen who are actually employed on the machines (among
whom are included a few who look after the engine), <a name="a99" class="calibre14" id="a99"></a>and into mere attendants
(almost exclusively children) of these workmen. Among the attendants are
reckoned more or less all “Feeders” who supply the machines with the material
to be worked. In addition to these two principal classes, there is a numerically
unimportant class of persons, whose occupation it is to look after the
whole of the machinery and repair it from time to time; such as engineers,
mechanics, joiners, &amp;c. This is a superior class of workmen, some of
them scientifically educated, others brought up to a trade; it is distinct
from the factory operative class, and merely aggregated to it. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n99" class="calibre1">[99]</a></sup> This division of labour is purely technical.

<p class="title"><!--397-->To work at a machine, the workman should be taught from
childhood, in order that he may learn to adapt his own movements to the
uniform and unceasing motion of an automaton. When the machinery, as a
whole, forms a system of manifold machines, working simultaneously and
in concert, the co-operation based upon it, requires the distribution of
various groups of workmen among the different kinds of machines. But the
employment of machinery does away with the necessity of crystallising this
distribution after the manner of Manufacture, by the constant annexation
of a particular man to a particular function. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n100" class="calibre1">[100]</a></sup>
Since the motion of the whole system does not proceed from the workman,
but from the machinery, a change of persons can take place at any time
without an interruption of the work. The most striking proof of this is
afforded by the <em class="calibre11">relays system</em>, put into operation by the manufacturers
during their revolt from 1848-1850. Lastly, the quickness with which machine
work is learnt by young people, does away with the necessity of bringing
up for exclusive employment by machinery, a special class of operatives.
<sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n101" class="calibre1">[101]</a></sup> With regard to the work of the mere attendants, it can, to some extent, be replaced in the mill by machines, <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n102" class="calibre1">[102]</a></sup> and <!--398-->owing to its extreme simplicity, it allows of a rapid and constant change of the individuals burdened with this drudgery.

<a name="a103" class="calibre14" id="a103"></a></p>
<p class="title">Although then, technically speaking, the old system of division
of labour is thrown overboard by machinery, it hangs on in the factory,
as a traditional habit handed down from Manufacture, and is afterwards
systematically re-moulded and established in a more hideous form by capital,
as a means of exploiting labour-power. The life-long speciality of handling
one and the same tool, now becomes the life-long speciality of serving
one and the same machine. Machinery is put to a wrong use, with the object
of transforming the workman, from his very childhood, into a part of a
detail-machine. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n103" class="calibre1">[103]</a></sup> In this way, not only are the
expenses of his reproduction considerably lessened, but at the same time
his helpless dependence upon the factory as a whole, and therefore upon
the capitalist, is rendered complete. Here as everywhere else, we must
distinguish between the increased productiveness due to the development
of the social process of production, and that due to the capitalist exploitation
of that process. In handicrafts and manufacture, the workman makes use
of a tool, in the factory, the machine makes use of him. <a name="a104" class="calibre14" id="a104"></a><a name="a105" class="calibre14" id="a105"></a>There the movements
of the instrument of labour proceed from him, here it is the movements
of the machine that he must follow. In manufacture the workmen are parts
of a living mechanism. In the factory we have a lifeless mechanism independent
of the workman, who becomes its mere living appendage.</p>
<p class="title"> “The miserable routine
of endless drudgery and toil in which the same mechanical process is gone
through over and over again, is like the labour of Sisyphus. The burden
of labour, like the rock, keeps ever falling back on the worn-out labourer.” 
<sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n104" class="calibre1">[104]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title">At the same time that factory work exhausts the nervous system to the uttermost, it does away with the many-sided play
of the muscles, and confiscates every atom of freedom, both in bodily and
intellectual activity. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n105" class="calibre1">[105]</a></sup> The lightening of the
labour, even, becomes a sort of torture, since the machine does not free
the labourer from work, but deprives the work of all interest. Every kind
of capitalist production, in so far as it is not only a labour-process,
but also a process of creating surplus-value, has this in common, that
it is not the workman that employs the instruments of labour, but <!--399-->the
instruments of labour that employ the workman. But it is only in the factory
system that this inversion for the first time acquires technical and palpable
reality. By means of its conversion into an automaton, the instrument of
labour confronts the labourer, during the labour-process, in the shape
of capital, of dead labour, that dominates, and pumps dry, living labour-power.
The separation of the intellectual powers of production from the manual
labour, and the conversion of those powers into the might of capital over
labour, is, as we have already shown. finally completed by modern industry
erected on the foundation of machinery. The special skill of each individual
insignificant factory operative vanishes as an infinitesimal quantity before
the science, the gigantic physical forces, and the mass of labour that
are embodied in the factory mechanism and, together with that mechanism,
constitute the power of the “master.” <a name="a106" class="calibre14" id="a106"></a>This “master,” therefore, in whose
brain the machinery and his monopoly of it are inseparably united, whenever
he falls out with his “hands,” contemptuously tells them:</p>
<p class="title"> “The factory operatives should keep in wholesome remembrance the fact that theirs is
really a low species of skilled labour; and that there is none which is
more easily acquired, or of its quality more amply remunerated, or which
by a short training of the least expert can be more quickly, as well as
abundantly, acquired.... The master’s machinery really plays a far more
important part in the business of production than the labour and the skill
of the operative, which six months’ education can teach, and a common labourer
can learn.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n106" class="calibre1">[106]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title">The technical subordination of the workman to the uniform motion of the instruments of labour, and the peculiar
composition of the body of workpeople, consisting as it does of individuals
of both sexes and of all ages, give rise to a barrack discipline, which
is elaborated into a complete system in the factory, and which fully develops
the before mentioned labour of overlooking, thereby dividing the workpeople
into operatives and overlookers, into private soldiers and sergeants of
an industrial army. “The main difficulty [in the automatic factory] ...
lay ... above all in training human beings to renounce their desultory
habits of work, and to identify themselves with the unvarying regularity
of the complex automaton. <a name="a107" class="calibre14" id="a107"></a>To devise and administer a successful code of
factory discipline, suited to the necessities of factory diligence, was
the Herculean enterprise, the noble achievement of Arkwright! Even at the
present day, when the system is perfectly organised and its labour lightened
to the utmost, it is found nearly impossible to convert persons past the
age of puberty, <!--400-->into useful factory hands.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n107" class="calibre1">[107]</a></sup> The factory code in which capital formulates, like a private legislator, and at his own good will, his autocracy over his workpeople, unaccompanied
by that division of responsibility, <a name="a108" class="calibre14" id="a108"></a>in other matters so much approved of
by the bourgeoisie, and unaccompanied by the still more approved representative
system, this code is but the capitalistic caricature of that social regulation
of the labour-process which becomes requisite in co-operation on a great
scale, and in the employment in common, of instruments of labour and especially
of machinery. The place of the slave-driver’s lash is taken by the overlooker’s
book of penalties. <a name="a109" class="calibre14" id="a109"></a><a name="a110" class="calibre14" id="a110"></a>All punishments naturally resolve themselves into fines and deductions from wages, and the law-giving talent of the factory Lycurgus so arranges matters, that a violation of his laws is, <a name="a111" class="calibre14" id="a111"></a>if possible, more profitable to him than the keeping of them. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n108" class="calibre1">[108]</a></sup><!--401-->We shall here merely allude to the material conditions under which factory labour is carried on. Every organ of sense is injured in an equal degree
by artificial elevation of the temperature, by the dust-laden atmosphere,
by the deafening noise, not to mention danger to life and limb among the
thickly crowded machinery, which, with the regularity of the seasons, issues
its list of the killed and wounded in the industrial battle. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n109" class="calibre1">[109]</a></sup> Economy of the social means of production, matured and <!--402-->forced as in a hothouse by the factory system, is turned, in the hands of capital,
into systematic robbery of what is necessary for the life of the workman
while he is at work, robbery of space, light, air, and of protection to
his person against the dangerous and unwholesome accompaniments of the
productive process, not to mention the robbery of appliances for the comfort
of the workman. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n110" class="calibre1">[110]</a></sup> Is Fourier wrong when he calls factories “tempered bagnos"? <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n111" class="calibre1">[111]</a></sup></p>

<hr class="end1"/><a name="a112" class="calibre14" id="a112"></a>
<p class="title">The contest between the capitalist and the wage-labourer
dates back to the very origin of capital. It raged on throughout the whole
manufacturing period. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n112" class="calibre1">[112]</a></sup> But only since the introduction of machinery has the workman fought against the instrument
of labour itself, the material embodiment of capital. He revolts against
this particular form of the means of production, as being the material
basis of the capitalist mode of production.
</p>
<p class="title">In the 17th century nearly all Europe experienced revolts of the
workpeople against the ribbon-loom, a machine for weaving ribbons and trimmings,
called in Germany Bandmühle, Schnurmühle, and Mühlenstuhl.
These machines were invented in Germany. Abbé Lancellotti, in a
work that appeared in Venice in 1636, but which was written in 1579, says
as follows:</p>
<p class="title"> “Anthony Müller of Danzig saw about 50 years ago in that
town, a very ingenious machine, which weaves 4 to 6 pieces at once. But
the Mayor being apprehensive that this invention might throw a large number
of workmen on the streets, caused the inventor to be secretly strangled
or drowned.” </p>
<p class="title">In Leyden, this machine was not used till 1629; there the
riots of the ribbon-weavers at length compelled the Town Council to prohibit
it.</p>
<p class="title">  “In hac urbe,” says Boxhorn (Inst. Pol., 1663), referring to the introduction
of this machine into Leyden, “ante hos viginti circiter annos instrumentum
quidam invenerunt textorium, quo solus plus panni et facilius conficere
poterat, quan plures aequali tempore. Hinc turbae ortae et querulae textorum,
tandemque usus hujus instrumenti a magistratu prohibitus est.” <br class="calibre5"/><span>[In this town, about twenty years ago certain people invented an instrument for weaving , with which a single person could weave more cloth, and more easily, than many others in the same length of time. As a result there arose disturbances and complaints from the weavers, until the Town Council finally prohibited the use of this instrument.]</span></p>
<p class="title">After making various decrees more or less prohibitive against this loom in 1632, 1639,
&amp;c., the States General of Holland at length permitted it to be used,
under certain conditions, by the decree of the 15th December, 1661. It
was also prohibited in Cologne in 1676, at the same time that its introduction
into England was causing disturbances among the workpeople. By an imperial
Edict of 19th Feb., 1685, its use was forbidden throughout all Germany.
In Hamburg it was burnt in public by order of the Senate. The Emperor Charles
VI., on 9th Feb., 1719, renewed the edict of 1685, and not till 1765 was
its use openly allowed in the Electorate of Saxony. This machine, which
shook Europe to its foundations, was in fact the precursor of the mule
and the power-loom, and of the industrial revolution of the 18th century.
It enabled a totally inexperienced boy, to set the whole loom with all
its shuttles in motion, by <!--404-->simply moving a rod backwards and
forwards, and in its improved form produced from 40 to 50 pieces at once.
</p>
<p class="title">About 1630, a wind-sawmill, erected near London by a Dutchman,
succumbed to the excesses of the populace. Even as late as the beginning
of the 18th century, sawmills driven by water overcame the opposition of
the people, supported as it was by Parliament, only with great difficulty.
No sooner had Everet in 1758 erected the first wool-shearing machine that
was driven by water-power, than it was set on fire by 100,000 people who
had been thrown out of work. Fifty thousand workpeople, who had previously
lived by <a name="a113" class="calibre14" id="a113"></a>carding wool, petitioned Parliament against Arkwright’s scribbling
mills and carding engines. The enormous destruction of machinery that occurred
in the English manufacturing districts during the first 15 years of this
century, chiefly caused by the employment of the power-loom, and known
as the Luddite movement, gave the anti-Jacobin governments of a Sidmouth,
a Castlereagh, and the like, a pretext for the most reactionary and forcible
measures. It took both time and experience before the workpeople learnt
to distinguish between machinery and its employment by capital, and to
direct their attacks, not against the material instruments of production,
but against the mode in which they are used. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n113" class="calibre1">[113]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title">The contests about wages in Manufacture, pre-suppose manufacture,
and are in no sense directed against its existence. The opposition against
the establishment of new manufactures, proceeds from the guilds and privileged
towns, not from the workpeople. Hence the writers of the manufacturing
period treat the division of labour chiefly as a means of virtually supplying
a deficiency of labourers, and not as a means of actually displacing those
in work. This distinction is self-evident. If it be said that 100 millions
of people would be required in England to spin with the old spinning-wheel
the cotton that is now spun with mules by 500,000 people, this does not
mean that the mules took the place of those millions who never existed.
It means only this, that many millions of workpeople would be required
to replace the spinning machinery. If, on the other hand, we say, that
in England the power-loom threw 800,000 weavers on the streets, we do not
refer to existing machinery, that would have to be replaced by a definite
number of workpeople, but to a number of weavers in existence who were
actually replaced or displaced by the looms. During the manufacturing period,
handicraft labour, altered though it was by division of labour, was. yet
the basis. <a name="a114" class="calibre14" id="a114"></a>The demands of the new colonial markets could not be satisfied
owing <!--405-->to the relatively small number of town operatives handed
down from the middle ages, and the manufactures proper opened out new fields
of production to the rural population, driven from the land by the dissolution
of the feudal system. At that time, therefore, division of labour and co-operation
in the workshops, were viewed more from the positive aspect, that they
made the workpeople more productive. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n114" class="calibre1">[114]</a></sup> Long before the period of modern industry, co-operation and the concentration of the
instruments of labour in the hands of a few, gave rise, in numerous countries
where these methods were applied in agriculture, to great, sudden and forcible
revolutions <a name="a115" class="calibre14" id="a115"></a>in the modes of production, and consequentially, in the conditions
of existence, and the means of employment of the rural populations. But
this contest at first takes place more between the large and the small
landed proprietors, than between capital and wage labour; on the other
hand, when the labourers are displaced by the instruments of labour, by
sheep, horses, &amp;c., in this case force is directly resorted to in the
first instance as the prelude to the industrial revolution. The labourers
are first driven from the land, and then come the sheep. Land grabbing
on a great scale, such as was perpetrated in England, is the first step
in creating a field for the establishment of agriculture on a great scale.
<sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n115" class="calibre1">[115]</a></sup> Hence this subversion of agriculture puts on,
at first, more the appearance of a political revolution.

<a name="a116" class="calibre14" id="a116"></a></p>
<p class="title">The instrument of labour, when it takes the form of a machine,
immediately becomes a competitor of the workman himself. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n116" class="calibre1">[116]</a></sup> The self-expansion of capital by means of machinery is thenceforward directly proportional to the number of the workpeople, whose means of livelihood
have been destroyed by that machinery. The whole system of capitalist production
is based on the fact that the workman sells his <!--406-->labour-power
as a commodity. Division of labour specialises this labour-power, by reducing
it to skill in handling a particular tool. So soon as the handling of this
tool becomes the work of a machine, then, with the use-value, the exchange-value
too, of the workman’s labour-power vanishes; the workman becomes unsaleable,
like paper money thrown out of currency by legal enactment. That portion
of the working-class, thus by machinery rendered superfluous, i.e., no
longer immediately necessary for the self-expansion of capital, either
goes to the wall in the unequal contest of the old handicrafts and manufactures
with machinery, or else floods all the more easily accessible branches
of industry, swamps the labour-market, and sinks the price of labour-power
below its value. It is impressed upon the workpeople, as a great consolation,
first, that their sufferings are only temporary (“a temporary inconvenience"),
secondly, that machinery acquires the mastery over the whole of a given
field of production, only by degrees, so that the extent and intensity
of its destructive effect is diminished. <a name="a117" class="calibre14" id="a117"></a><a name="a118" class="calibre14" id="a118"></a>The first consolation neutralises the second. When machinery seizes on an industry by degrees, it produces
chronic misery among the operatives who compete with it. Where the transition
is rapid, the effect is acute and felt by great masses. History discloses
no tragedy more horrible than the gradual extinction of the English hand-loom
weavers, an extinction that was spread over several decades, and finally
sealed in 1838. Many of them died of starvation, many with families vegetated
for a long time on 2½ d. a day. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n117" class="calibre1">[117]</a></sup><!-- volume 35 p 435--> On the other hand, the English cotton machinery produced an acute effect in India. The Governor General reported 1834-35:</p>
<p class="title">  “The misery hardly finds a parallel
in the history of commerce. The bones of the cotton-weavers are bleaching
the plains of India.” </p>
<p class="title">No doubt, in turning <!--407-->them out of this
 “temporal” world, the machinery caused them no more than “a temporary inconvenience.” 
 For the rest, since machinery is continually seizing upon new fields of
production, its temporary effect is really permanent. Hence, the character
of independence and estrangement which the capitalist mode of production
as a whole gives to the instruments of labour and to the product, as against
the workman, is developed by means of machinery into a thorough antagonism.
<sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n118" class="calibre1">[118]</a></sup> Therefore, it is with the advent of machinery, that the workman for the first time brutally revolts against the instruments
of labour.

<a name="a119" class="calibre14" id="a119"></a>
<a name="a120" class="calibre14" id="a120"></a>
<a name="a121" class="calibre14" id="a121"></a></p>
<p class="title">The instrument of labour strikes down the labourer. This direct
antagonism between the two comes out most strongly, whenever newly introduced
machinery competes with handicrafts or manufactures, handed down from former
times. But even in modern industry the continual improvement of machinery,
and the development of the automatic system, has an analogous effect.</p>
<p class="title">  “The object of improved machinery is to diminish manual labour, to provide for
the performance of a process or the completion of a link in a manufacture
by the aid of an iron instead of the human apparatus.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n119" class="calibre1">[119]</a></sup> “The adaptation of power to machinery heretofore moved by hand, is almost of daily occurrence ... the minor improvements in machinery having for
their object economy of power, the production of better work, the turning
off more work in the same time, or in supplying the place of a child, a
female, or a man, are constant, and although sometimes apparently of no
great moment, have somewhat important results.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n120" class="calibre1">[120]</a></sup> “Whenever a process requires peculiar dexterity and steadiness of hand, it is withdrawn, as soon as possible, <a name="a122" class="calibre14" id="a122"></a><a name="a123" class="calibre14" id="a123"></a><a name="a124" class="calibre14" id="a124"></a>from the cunning workman, who is prone to irregularities of many kinds, and it is placed in charge of a peculiar mechanism, so self-regulating that a child can superintend it.” 
 <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n121" class="calibre1">[121]</a></sup> “On the automatic plan <!--408-->skilled labour gets progressively superseded.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n122" class="calibre1">[122]</a></sup> “The effect of improvements in machinery, not merely in superseding the necessity for
the employment of the same quantity of adult labour as before, in order
to produce a given result, but in substituting one description of human
labour for another, the less skilled for the more skilled, juvenile for
adult, female for male, causes a fresh disturbance in the rate of wages.” 
 <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n123" class="calibre1">[123]</a></sup> “The effect of substituting the self-acting mule for the common mule, is to discharge the greater part of the men spinners,
and to retain adolescents and children.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n124" class="calibre1">[124]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title">The extraordinary power of expansion of the factory system owing to accumulated
practical experience, to the mechanical means at hand, and to constant
technical progress, was proved to us by the giant strides of that system
under the pressure of a shortened working-day. But who, in 1860, the Zenith
year of the English cotton industry, would have dreamt of the galloping
improvements in machinery, and the corresponding displacement of working
people, called into being during the following 3 years, under the stimulus
of the American Civil War? A couple of examples from the Reports of the
Inspectors of Factories will suffice on this point. A Manchester manufacturer states:</p>
<p class="title"> “We formerly had 75 carding engines, now we have 12, doing the
same quantity of work.... We are doing with fewer hands by 14, at a saving
in wages of £10 a-week. Our estimated saving in waste is about 10%
in the quantity of cotton consumed.” “In another fine-spinning mill in
Manchester, I was informed that through increased speed and the adoption
of some self-acting processes, a reduction had been made, in number, of
a fourth in one department, and of above half in another, and that the
introduction of the combing machine in place of the second carding, had
considerably reduced, the number of hands formerly employed in the carding-room.” </p>
<p class="title">Another spinning-mill is estimated to effect a saving of labour of 10%.
The Messrs. Gilmour, spinners at Manchester, state: “In our blowing-room
department we consider our expense with new machinery is fully one-third
less in wages and hands ... in the jack-frame and drawing-frame room, about
one-third less in expense, and likewise one-third less in hands; in the
spinning room about one-third less in expenses. <a name="a125" class="calibre14" id="a125"></a><a name="a126" class="calibre14" id="a126"></a>But this is not all; when our yarn goes to the manufacturers, it is so much better by the application
of our new machinery, that they will produce a greater quantity of cloth, and
cheaper than from the yarn produced by old machinery.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n125" class="calibre1">[125]</a></sup> Mr. Redgrave further remarks in the same Report:</p>
<p class="title">  “The reduction of hands against increased production is, in fact, constantly taking place, in woollen
mills the reduction commenced some time since, and is continuing; a few
days since, the master of a school in the neighbourhood of Rochdale said
to me, that the great falling off in the girls’ school is not only caused
by the distress, but by the changes of machinery in the woollen mills,
in consequence of which a reduction of 70 short-timers had taken place.”

words more productive machinery on a larger scale was concentrated in the
hands of a smaller number of capitalists. The number of power-looms decreased
by 20,663; but since their product increased in the same period, an improved
loom must have yielded more than an old one. Lastly the number of spindles
increased by 1,612,541, while the number of operatives decreased by 50,505.
The “temporary” misery inflicted on the workpeople by the cotton-crisis,
was heightened, and from being temporary made permanent, by the rapid and
persistent progress of machinery.

</p><p class="title">But machinery not only acts as a competitor who gets the better
of the workman, and is constantly on the point of making him superfluous.
It is also a power inimical to him, and as such capital proclaims it from
the roof tops and as such makes use of it. It is the most powerful weapon
for repressing strikes, those periodical revolts of the working-class against
the autocracy of capital.<sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n127" class="calibre1">[127]</a></sup> According to Gaskell, the steam-engine was from the very first an antagonist of human power,
an antagonist that enabled the capitalist to tread under foot the growing
claims of the workmen, who threatened the newly born factory
system with a crisis.<sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n128" class="calibre1">[128]</a></sup> It would be possible to
write quite a history of the inventions, made since 1830, for the sole
purpose of supplying capital with weapons against the revolts of the working-class.
At the head of these in importance, stands the self-acting mule, because
it opened up a new epoch in the automatic system.<sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n129" class="calibre1">[129]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title">Nasmyth, the inventor of the steam-hammer, gives the following
evidence before the Trades’ Union Commission, with regard to the improvements
made by him in machinery and introduced in consequence of the wide-spread
and long strikes of the engineers in 1851.</p>
<p class="title"> “The characteristic feature
of our modern mechanical improvements, is the introduction of self-acting
tool machinery. What every mechanical workman has now to do, and what every
boy can do, is not to work himself but to superintend the beautiful labour
of the machine. The whole class of workmen that depend exclusively on their
skill, is now done away with. Formerly, I employed four boys to every mechanic.
Thanks to these new mechanical combinations, I have reduced the number
of grown-up men from 1,500 to 750. The result was a considerable increase
in my profits.” 
 </p>
<p class="title">Ure says of a machine used in calico printing:</p>
<p class="title"> “At length capitalists
sought deliverance from this intolerable bondage” [namely the, in their
eyes, burdensome terms of their contracts with the workmen] “in the resources
of science, and were speedily re-instated in their legitimate rule, that
of the head over the inferior members.” </p>
<p class="title">Speaking of an invention for dressing warps:</p>
<p class="title">  “Then the combined malcontents, who fancied themselves impregnably
entrenched behind the old lines of division of labour, found their flanks
turned and their defences rendered useless by the new mechanical tactics,
and were obliged to surrender at discretion.” <a name="a130" class="calibre14" id="a130"></a></p>
<p class="title">With regard to the invention of the self-acting mule, he says:</p>
<p class="title">  “A creation destined to restore order
among the industrious classes.... This invention confirms the great doctrine
already propounded, that when capital enlists science into her service,
the refractory hand of labour will always be taught docility.”<sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n130" class="calibre1">[130]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title">Although Ure’s work appeared 30 years ago, at a time when the factory system was comparatively but little developed, it still perfectly expresses the spirit of the factory, not only by its undisguised cynicism, but also by
the naïveté with which it blurts out the stupid contradictions of
the capitalist brain. For instance, after propounding the “doctrine” stated
above, that capital, with the aid of science taken into its pay, always
reduces the refractory hand of <!--412-->labour to docility, he grows
indignant because</p>
<p class="title">  “it (physico-mechanical science) has been accused of
lending itself to the rich capitalist as an instrument for harassing the
poor.” </p>
<p class="title">After preaching a long sermon to show how advantageous the rapid
development of machinery is to the working-classes, he warns them, that
by their obstinacy and their strikes they hasten that development.</p>
<p class="title">  “Violent revulsions of this nature,” he says, “display short-sighted man in the
contemptible character of a self-tormentor.” </p>
<p class="title">A few pages before he states the contrary.</p>
<p class="title">  “Had it not been for the violent collisions and interruptions
resulting from erroneous views among the factory operatives, the factory
system would have been developed still more rapidly and beneficially for
all concerned.” Then he exclaims again: “Fortunately for the state of society
in the cotton districts of Great Britain, the improvements in machinery
are gradual.” “It” (improvement in machinery) “is said to lower the rate
of earnings of adults by displacing a portion of them, and thus rendering
their number superabundant as compared with the demand for their labour.
It certainly augments the demand for the labour of children and increases
the rate of <em class="calibre11">their </em>wages.” <a name="a131" class="calibre14" id="a131"></a></p>
<p class="title">On the other hand, this same dispenser
of consolation defends the lowness of the children’s wages on the ground
that it prevents parents from sending their children at too early an age
into the factory. The whole of his book is a vindication of a working-day
of unrestricted length; that Parliament should forbid children of 13 years
to be exhausted by working 12 hours a day, reminds his liberal soul of
the darkest days of the Middle Ages. This does not prevent him from calling
upon the factory operatives to thank Providence, who by means of machinery
has given them the leisure to think of their “immortal interests.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n131" class="calibre1">[131]</a></sup></p>

<hr class="end1"/><h3 id="calibre_toc_78" class="calibre17">SECTION 6 - THE THEORY OF COMPENSATION AS REGARDS THE WORKPEOPLE DISPLACED BY MACHINERY</h3>

<hr class="end1"/><a name="a132" class="calibre14" id="a132"></a>
<p class="title">James Mill, MacCulloch, Torrens, Senior, John Stuart
Mill, and a whole series besides, of bourgeois political economists, insist
that all machinery that displaces workmen, simultaneously and necessarily
sets free an amount of capital adequate to employ the same identical workmen.
<sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n132" class="calibre1">[132]</a></sup><a name="a133" class="calibre14" id="a133"></a></p>
<p class="title">Suppose a capitalist to employ 100 workmen, at £30 a year
each, in a carpet factory. The variable capital annually laid out amounts, <!--413-->therefore,
to £3,000. Suppose, also, that he discharges 50 of his workmen, and
employs the remaining 50 with machinery that costs him £1,500. To
simplify matters, we take no account of buildings, coal, &amp;c. Further
suppose that the raw material annually consumed costs £3,000, both
before and after the change. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n133" class="calibre1">[133]</a></sup> Is any capital set free by this metamorphosis? Before the change, the total sum of £6,000
consisted half of constant, and half of variable capital. After the change
it consists of £4,500 constant ( £3,000 raw material and £1,500
machinery), and £1,500 variable capital. The variable capital, instead
of being one half, is only one quarter, of the total capital. Instead of
being set free, a part of the capital is here locked up in such a way as
to cease to be exchanged against labour-power: variable has been changed
into constant capital. Other things remaining unchanged, the capital of
£6,000, can, in future, employ no more than 50 men. With each improvement
in the machinery, it will employ fewer. If the newly introduced machinery
had cost less than did the labour-power and implements displaced by it,
if, for instance, instead of costing £1,500, it had cost only £1,000,
a variable capital of £1,000 would have been converted into constant
capital, and locked up; and a capital of £500 would have been set
free. The latter sum, supposing wages unchanged, would form a fund sufficient
to employ about 16 out of the 50 men discharged; nay, less than 16, for,
in order to be employed as capital, a part of this £500 must now
become constant capital, thus leaving only the remainder to be laid out
in labour-power.
</p>
<p class="title">But, suppose, besides, that the making of the new machinery affords
employment to a greater number of mechanics, can that be called compensation
to the carpet-makers, thrown on the streets? At the best, its construction
employs fewer men than its employment displaces. The sum of £1,500
that formerly represented the wages of the discharged carpet-makers, now
represents in the shape of machinery: (1) the value of the means of production
used in the construction of that machinery, (2) the wages of the mechanics
employed in its construction, and (3) the surplus-value failing to the
share of their “master.” Further, the machinery need not be renewed till
it is worn out. Hence, in order to keep the increased number of mechanics
in constant employment, one carpet manufacturer after another must displace
workmen by machines.
</p>
<p class="title">As a matter of fact the apologists do not mean this sort of setting
free.
</p>
<p class="title">They have in their minds the means of subsistence of the liberated
work-people. It cannot be denied, in the above instance, that the machinery
not only liberates 50 men, thus placing them at others’ disposal, but, <!--414-->at
the same time, it withdraws from their consumption, and sets free, means
of subsistence to the value of £1,500. The simple fact, by no means
a new one, that machinery cuts off the workmen from their means of subsistence
is, therefore, in economic parlance tantamount to this, that machinery
liberates means of subsistence for the workman, or converts those means
into capital for his employment. The mode of expression, you see, is everything.
Nominibus mollire licet mala.
</p>
<p class="title">This theory implies that the £1,500 worth of means of subsistence
was capital that was being expanded by the labour of the 50 men discharged.
That, consequently, this capital falls out of employment so soon as they
commence their forced holidays, and never rests till it has found a fresh
investment, where it can again be productively consumed by these same 50
men. That sooner or later, therefore, the capital and the workmen must
come together again, and that, then, the compensation is complete. That
the sufferings of the workmen displaced by machinery are therefore as transient
as are the riches of this world.
</p>
<p class="title">In relation to the discharged workmen, the £1,500 worth
of means of subsistence never was capital. What really confronted them
as capital, was the sum of £1,500, afterwards laid out in machinery.
On looking closer it will be seen that this sum represented part of the
carpets produced in a year by the 50 discharged men, which part they received
as wages from their employer in money instead of in kind. With the carpets
in the form of money, they bought means of subsistence to the value of
£1,500. These means, therefore, were to them, not capital, but commodities,
and they, as regards these commodities, were not wage-labourers, but buyers.
The circumstance that they were “freed” by the machinery, from the means
of purchase, changed them from buyers into non-buyers. Hence a lessened
demand for those commodities — voilà tout. If this diminution be
not compensated by an increase from some other quarter, the market price
of the commodities falls. If this state of things lasts for some time,
and extends, there follows a discharge of workmen employed in the production
of these commodities. Some of the capital that was previously devoted to
production of necessary means of subsistence, has to become reproduced
in another form. While prices fall, and capital is being displaced, the
labourers employed in the production of necessary means of subsistence
are in their turn “freed” from a part of their wages. Instead, therefore,
of proving that, when machinery frees the workman from his means of subsistence,
it simultaneously converts those means into capital for his further employment,
our apologists, with their cut-and-dried law of supply and demand, prove,
on the contrary, that machinery throws workmen on the streets, <!--415-->not
only in that branch of production in which it is introduced, but also in
those branches in which it is not introduced.
</p>
<p class="title">The real facts, which are travestied by the optimism of economists,
are as follows: The labourers, when driven out of the workshop by the machinery,
are thrown upon the labour market, and there add to the number of workmen
at the disposal of the capitalists. In Part VII of this book it will be
seen that this effect of machinery, which, as we have seen, is represented
to be a compensation to the working class, is on the contrary a most frightful
scourge. For the present I will only say this: The labourers that are thrown
out of work in any branch of industry, can no doubt seek for employment
in some other branch. <a name="a134" class="calibre14" id="a134"></a>If they find it, and thus renew the bond between
them and the means of subsistence, this takes place only by the intermediary
of a new and additional capital that is seeking investment; not at all
by the intermediary of the capital that formerly employed them and was
afterwards converted into machinery. And even should they find employment,
what a poor look-out is theirs! Crippled as they are by division of labour,
these poor devils are worth so little outside their old trade, that they
cannot find admission into any industries, except a few of inferior kind,
that are over-supplied with underpaid workmen. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n134" class="calibre1">[134]</a></sup> Further, every branch of industry attracts each year a new stream of men, who furnish a contingent from which to fill up vacancies, and to draw a
supply for expansion. So soon as machinery sets free a part of the workmen
employed in a given branch of industry, the reserve men are also diverted
into new channels of employment, and become absorbed in other branches;
meanwhile the original victims, during the period of transition, for the
most part starve and perish.
</p>
<p class="title">It is an undoubted fact that machinery, as such, is not responsible
for “setting free” the workman from the means of subsistence. It cheapens
and increases production in that branch which it seizes on, and at first
makes no change in the mass of the means of subsistence produced in other
branches. Hence, after its introduction, the society possesses as much,
if not more, of the necessaries of life than before, for the labourers
thrown out of work; and that quite apart from the enormous share of the
annual produce wasted by the non-workers. And this is the point <!--416-->relied
on by our apologists! The contradictions and antagonisms inseparable from
the capitalist employment of machinery, do not exist, they say, since they
do not arise out of machinery, as such, but out of its capitalist employment!
Since therefore machinery, considered alone, shortens the hours of labour,
but, when in the service of capital, lengthens them; since in itself it
lightens labour, but when employed by capital, heightens the intensity
of labour; since in itself it is a victory of man over the forces of Nature,
but in the hands of capital, makes man the slave of those forces; since
in itself it increases the wealth of the producers, but in the hands of
capital, makes them paupers-for all these reasons and others besides, says
the bourgeois economist without more ado, it is clear as noon-day that
all these contradictions are a mere semblance of the reality, and that,
as a matter of fact, they have neither an actual nor a theoretical existence.
Thus he saves himself from all further puzzling of the brain, and what
is more, implicitly declares his opponent to be stupid enough to contend
against, not the capitalistic employment of machinery, but machinery itself.

<a name="a135" class="calibre14" id="a135"></a>
<a name="a136" class="calibre14" id="a136"></a></p>
<p class="title">No doubt he is far from denying that temporary inconvenience may
result from the capitalist use of machinery. But where is the medal without
its reverse! Any employment of machinery, except by capital, is to him
an impossibility. Exploitation of the workman by the machine is therefore,
with him, identical with exploitation of the machine by the workman. Whoever,
therefore, exposes the real state of things in the capitalistic employment
of machinery, is against its employment in any way, and is an enemy of
social progress! <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n135" class="calibre1">[135]</a></sup> Exactly the reasoning of the
celebrated Bill Sykes. “Gentlemen of the jury, no doubt the throat of this
commercial traveller has been cut. But that is not my fault, it is the
fault of the knife. Must we, for such a temporary inconvenience, abolish
the use of the knife? Only consider! where would agriculture and trade
be without the knife? Is it not as salutary in surgery, as it is knowing
in anatomy? And in addition a willing help at the festive board? If you
abolish the knife — you hurl us back into the depths of barbarism.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n136" class="calibre1">[136]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title"><!--417-->Although machinery necessarily throws men out of work in
those industries into which it is introduced, yet it may, notwithstanding
this, bring about an increase of employment in other industries. This effect,
however, has nothing in common with the so-called theory of compensation.
Since every article produced by a machine is cheaper than a similar article
produced by hand, we deduce the following infallible law: If the total
quantity of the article produced by machinery, be equal to the total quantity
of the article previously produced by a handicraft or by manufacture, and
now made by machinery, then the total labour expended is diminished. The
new labour spent on the instruments of labour, on the machinery, on the
coal, and so on, must necessarily be less than the labour displaced by
the use of the machinery; otherwise the product of the machine would be
as dear, or dearer, than the product of the manual labour. But, as a matter
of fact, the total quantity of the article produced by machinery with a
diminished number of workmen, instead of remaining equal to, by far exceeds
the total quantity of the hand-made article that has been displaced. Suppose
that 400,000 yards of cloth have been produced on power-looms by fewer
weavers than could weave 100,000 yards by hand. In the quadrupled product
there lies four times as much raw material. Hence the production of raw
material must be quadrupled. But as regards the instruments of labour,
such as buildings, coal, machinery, and so on, it is different; the limit
up to which the additional labour required for their production can increase,
varies with the difference between the quantity of the machine-made article,
and the quantity of the same article that the same number of workmen could
make by hand.
</p>
<p class="title">Hence, as the use of machinery extends in a given industry, the
immediate effect is to increase production in the other industries that
furnish the first with means of production. <a name="a137" class="calibre14" id="a137"></a><a name="a138" class="calibre14" id="a138"></a><a name="a139" class="calibre14" id="a139"></a>How far employment is thereby found for an increased number of men, depends, given the length of the working-day and the intensity of labour, on the composition of the capital employed, i.e., on the ratio of its constant to its variable component.
This ratio, in its turn, varies considerably with the extent to which machinery
has already seized on, or is then seizing on, those trades. The number
of the men condemned to work in coal and metal mines increased enormously
owing to the progress of the English factory system; but during the last
few decades this increase of number has been less rapid, owing to the use
of new machinery in mining. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n137" class="calibre1">[137]</a></sup> A new <!--418-->type of workman springs into life along with the machine, namely, its maker.
We have already learnt that machinery has possessed itself even. of this
branch of production on a scale that grows greater every day. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n138" class="calibre1">[138]</a></sup> As to raw material, <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n139" class="calibre1">[139]</a></sup> there is not the least doubt that the rapid strides of cotton spinning, not only pushed on with tropical luxuriance the growth of cotton in the United States, and with it the African slave trade, but also made the breeding of slaves the chief business of
the border slave-states. When, in 1790, the first census of slaves was
taken in the United States, their number was 697,000; in 1861 it had nearly
reached four millions. On the other hand, it is no less certain that the
rise of the English woollen factories, together with the gradual conversion
of arable land into sheep pasture, brought, about the superfluity of agricultural
labourers that led to their being driven in masses into the towns. Ireland,
having during the last twenty years reduced its population by nearly one
half, is at this moment undergoing the process of still further reducing
the number of its inhabitants, so as exactly to suit the requirements of
its landlords and of the English woollen manufacturers.

<a name="a140" class="calibre14" id="a140"></a></p>
<p class="title">When machinery is applied to any of the preliminary or intermediate
stages through which the subject of labour has to pass on its way to completion,
there is an increased yield of material in those stages, and simultaneously
an increased demand for labour in the handicrafts or manufactures supplied
by the produce of the machines. Spinning by machinery, for example, supplied
yarn so cheaply and so abundantly that the hand-loom weavers were, at first,
able to work full time without increased outlay. Their earnings accordingly
rose. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n140" class="calibre1">[140]</a></sup> Hence a flow of people into the cotton-weaving trade, till at length the 800,000 weavers, called into existence by the
Jenny, the throstle and the mule, were overwhelmed by the power-loom. So
also, owing to the abundance of clothing materials produced by machinery,
the number of tailors, seamstresses and needlewomen, went on increasing
until the appearance of the sewing-machine.
</p>
<p class="title"><!--419-->In proportion as machinery, with the aid of a relatively
small number of workpeople, increases the mass of raw materials, intermediate
products, instruments of labour, &amp;c., the working-up of these raw materials
and intermediate products becomes split up into numberless branches; social
production increases in diversity. The factory system carries the social
division of labour immeasurably further than does manufacture, for it increases
the productiveness of the industries it seizes upon, in a far higher degree.

<a name="a141" class="calibre14" id="a141"></a>
<a name="a142" class="calibre14" id="a142"></a></p>
<p class="title">The immediate result of machinery is to augment surplus-value
and the mass of products in which surplus-value is embodied. And, as the
substances consumed by the capitalists and their dependents become more
plentiful, so too do these orders of society. Their growing wealth, and
the relatively diminished number of workmen required to produce the necessaries
of life beget, simultaneously with the rise of new and luxurious wants,
the means of satisfying those wants. A larger portion of the produce of
society is changed into surplus-produce, and a larger part of the surplus-produce
is supplied for consumption in a multiplicity of refined shapes. In other
words, the production of luxuries increases. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n141" class="calibre1">[141]</a></sup>
The refined and varied forms of the products are also due to new relations
with the markets of the world, relations that are created by modern industry.
Not only are greater quantities of foreign articles of luxury exchanged
for home products, but a greater mass of foreign raw materials, ingredients,
and intermediate products, are used as means of production in the home
industries. Owing to these relations with the markets of the world, the
demand for labour increases in the carrying trades, which split up into
numerous varieties. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n142" class="calibre1">[142]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title">The increase of the means of production and subsistence, accompanied
by a relative diminution in the number of labourers, causes an increased
demand for labour in making canals, docks, tunnels, bridges, and so on,
works that can only bear fruit in the far future. Entirely new branches
of production, creating new fields of labour, are also formed, as the direct
result either of machinery or of the general industrial changes brought
about by it. But the place occupied by these branches in the general production
is, even in the most developed countries, far from important. The number
of labourers that find employment in them is directly proportional to the
demand, created by those industries, for the crudest form of manual labour.
The chief industries of this kind are, at present, gas-works, telegraphs,
photography, steam navigation, and railways. According to the census of
1861 for England and Wales, <!--420-->we find in the gas industry (gas-works,
production of mechanical apparatus, servants of . the gas companies, &amp;c),
15,211 persons; in telegraphy, 2,399; in photography, 2,366; steam navigation,
3,570; and in railways, 70,599, of whom the unskilled “navvies,” more or
less permanently employed, and the whole administrative and commercial
staff, make up about 28,000. The total number of persons, therefore, employed
in these five new industries amounts to 94,145.
</p>
<p class="title">Lastly, the extraordinary productiveness of modern industry, accompanied
as it is by both a more extensive and a more intense exploitation of labour-power
in all other spheres of production, allows of the unproductive employment
of a larger and larger part of the working-class, and the consequent reproduction,
on a constantly extending scale, of the ancient domestic slaves under the

Wales was 20,066,244; of these, 9,776,259 males, and 10,289,965 females.

work, all unproductive women, young persons and children, the “ideological” 
 classes, such as government officials, priests, lawyers, soldiers, &amp;c.;
further, all who have no occupation but to consume the labour of others
in the form of rent, interest, &amp;c.; and, lastly, paupers, vagabonds,
and criminals, there remain in round numbers eight millions of the two
