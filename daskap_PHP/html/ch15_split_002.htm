<h4 class="calibre15">D. Modern Domestic Industry</h4>

<a name="a179" class="calibre14" id="a179"></a>
<p class="title">I now come to the so-called domestic industry. In order to get an idea
of the horrors of this sphere, in which capital conducts its exploitation
in the background of modern mechanical industry, one must go to the apparently
quite idyllic trade of nail-making, <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n179" class="calibre1">[179]</a></sup> carried on in a few remote villages of England. In this place, however, it will be
enough to give a few examples from those branches of the lace-making and
straw-plaiting industries that are not yet carried on by the aid of machinery,
and that as yet do not compete with branches carried on in factories or
in manufactories.
</p>
<p class="title">Of the 150,000 persons employed in England in the production of
lace, about 10,000 fall under the authority of the Factory Act, 1861. Almost
the whole of the remaining 140,000 are women, young persons, and children
of both sexes, the male sex, however, being weakly represented. The state
of health of this cheap material for exploitation will be seen from the
following table, computed by Dr. Trueman, physician to the Nottingham General
Dispensary. Out of 686 female patients who were lace-makers, most of them
between the ages of 17 and 24, the number of consumptive ones were:

<a name="a180" class="calibre14" id="a180"></a></p>
<table border="0" class="calibre22"><tr class="calibre23"><td class="textc"><b class="calibre10">1852</b>. — 1 in 45.</td><td class="textc"><b class="calibre10">1857</b>. — 1 in 13.</td></tr><tr class="calibre23"><td class="textc"><b class="calibre10">1853</b>. — 1 in 28.</td><td class="textc"><b class="calibre10">1858</b>. — 1 in 15.</td></tr><tr class="calibre23"><td class="textc"><b class="calibre10">1854</b>. — 1 in 17.</td><td class="textc"><b class="calibre10">1859</b>. — 1 in 9.</td></tr><tr class="calibre23"><td class="textc"><b class="calibre10">1856</b>. — 1 in 15.</td><td class="textc"><b class="calibre10">1861</b>. — 1 in 8. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n180" class="calibre1">[180]</a></sup></td></tr></table><p class="title">This progress in the rate of consumption ought to suffice for the most
optimist of progressists, and for the biggest hawker of lies among the
Free-trade bagmen of Germany.
</p>
<p class="title">The Factory Act of 1861 regulates the actual making of the lace,
so far as it is done by machinery, and this is the rule in England. The
branches that we are now about to examine, solely with regard to those
of the workpeople who work at home, and not those who work in manufactories
or warehouses, fall into two divisions, viz. (1), finishing; (2), mending.
The former gives the finishing touches to the machine-made lace, and includes
numerous sub-divisions.
</p>
<p class="title">The lace finishing is done either in what are called “mistresses’
houses,” or by women in their own houses, with or without the help of their
children. The women who keep the “mistresses’ houses” are themselves poor.
The workroom is in a private house. The mistresses take orders from manufacturers,
or from warehousemen, and employ as many women, girls, and young children
as the size of their rooms and the fluctuating demand of the business will
allow. The number of the workwomen employed in these workrooms varies from
20 to 40 in some, and from 10 to 20 in others. The average age at which
the children commence work is six years, but in many cases it is below
five. The usual working-hours are from 8 in the morning till eight in the
evening, with 1½ hours for meals, which are taken at irregular intervals,
and often in the foul workrooms. When business is brisk, the labour frequently
lasts from 8 or even 6 o’clock in the morning till 10, 11, or 12 o’clock
at night. In English barracks the regulation space allotted to each soldier
is 500-600 cubic feet, and in the military hospitals 1,200 cubic feet.
But in those finishing sties there are but 67 to 100 cubic feet to each
person. At the same time the oxygen of the air is consumed by gas-lights.
In order to keep the lace clean, and although the floor is tiled or gagged,
the children are often compelled, even in winter, to pull off their shoes.</p>
<p class="title"> “It is not at all uncommon in Nottingham to find 14 to 20 children huddled
together in a small room, of, perhaps, not more than 12 feet square, and
employed for 15 hours out of the 24, at work that of itself is exhausting,
from its weariness and monotony, and is besides carried on under every
possible unwholesome condition.... Even the very youngest children work
with a strained attention and a rapidity that is astonishing, hardly ever
giving their fingers rest or glowering their motion. If a question
be asked them, they never raise their eyes from their work from fear of
losing a single moment.” </p>
<p class="title">The “long stick” is used by the mistresses as
a stimulant more and more as the working hours are prolonged. <a name="a181" class="calibre14" id="a181"></a><a name="a182" class="calibre14" id="a182"></a></p>
<p class="title"> “The children gradually tire and become as restless as birds towards the end of their long detention at an occupation that is monotonous, eye-straining, and
exhausting from the uniformity in the posture of the body. Their work is
like slavery.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n181" class="calibre1">[181]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title"> When women and their children
work at home, which now-a-days means in a hired room, often in a garret,
the state of things is, if possible, still worse. This sort of work is
given out within a circle of 80 miles radius from Nottingham. On leaving
the warehouses at 9 or 10 o’clock at night, the children are often given
a bundle of lace to take home with them and finish. The Pharisee of a capitalist
represented by one of his servants, accompanies this action, of course,
with the unctuous phrase: “That’s for mother,” yet he knows well enough
that the poor children must sit up and help. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n182" class="calibre1">[182]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title">Pillow lace-making is chiefly carried on in England in two agricultural
districts; one, the Honiton lace district, extending from 20 to 30 miles
along the south coast of Devonshire, and including a few places in North
Devon; the other comprising a great part of the counties of Buckingham,
Bedford, and Northampton, and also the adjoining portions of Oxfordshire
and Huntingdonshire. The cottages of the agricultural labourers are the
places where the work is usually carried on. Many manufacturers employ
upwards of 3,000 of these lace-makers, who are chiefly children and young
persons of the female sex exclusively. The state of things described as
incidental to lace finishing is here repeated, save that instead of the
 “mistresses’ houses,” we find what are called “lace-schools,” kept by poor
women in their cottages. From their fifth year and often earlier, until
their twelfth or fifteenth year, the children work in these schools; during
the <a name="a183" class="calibre14" id="a183"></a>first year the very young ones work from four to eight hours, and later
on, from six in the morning till eight and ten o’clock at night.</p>
<p class="title"> “The rooms are generally the ordinary living rooms of small cottages, the chimney
stopped up to keep out draughts, the inmates kept warm by their own animal
heat alone, and this frequently in winter. In other cases, these so-called
school-rooms are like small store-rooms without fire-places.... The over-crowding
in these dens and the consequent vitiation of the air are often extreme.
Added to this is the injurious effect of drains, privies, decomposing substances,
and other filth usual in the purlieus of the smaller cottages.” With regard
to space: “In one lace-school 18 girls and a mistress, 35 cubic
feet to each person; in another, where the smell was unbearable, 18 persons
and 24½ cubic feet per head. In this industry are to be found employed
children of 2 and 2½ years.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n183" class="calibre1">[183]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title">Where lace-making ends in the counties of Buckingham and Bedford,
straw-plaiting begins, and extends over a large part of Hertfordshire and
the westerly and northerly parts of Essex. In 1861, there were 40,043 persons
employed in straw-plaiting and straw-hat making; of these 3,815 were males
of all ages, the rest females, of whom 14,913, including about 7,000 children,
were under 20 years of age. In the place of the lace-schools we find here
the “straw-plait schools.” The children commence their instruction in straw-plaiting
generally in their 4th, often between their 3rd and 4th year. Education,
of course, they get none. The children themselves call the elementary schools,
 “natural schools,” to distinguish them from these blood-sucking institutions,
in which they are kept at work simply to get through the task, generally
30 yards daily, prescribed by their half-starved mothers. These same mothers
often make them work at home, after school is over, till 10, 11, and 12
o’clock at night. The straw cuts their mouths, with which they constantly
moisten it, and their fingers. Dr. Ballard gives it as the general opinion
of the whole body of medical officers in London, that 300 cubic feet is
the minimum space proper for each person in a bedroom or workroom. But
in the straw-plait schools space is more sparingly allotted than in the
lace-schools, “12 2/3, 17, 18½ and below 22 cubic feet for each person.” </p>
<p class="title"> “The smaller of these numbers, says one of the commissioners, Mr. White,
represents less space than the half of what a child would occupy if packed
in a <a name="a184" class="calibre14" id="a184"></a>box measuring 3 feet in each direction.” </p>
<p class="title">Thus do the children enjoy
life till the age of 12 or 14. The wretched half-starved parents think
of nothing but getting as much as possible out of their children. The latter,
as soon as they are grown up, do not care a farthing, and naturally so,
for their parents, and leave them.</p>
<p class="title">  “It is no wonder that ignorance and
vice abound in a population so brought up.... Their morality is at the
lowest ebb,... a great number of the women have illegitimate children,
and that at such an immature age that even those most conversant with criminal
statistics are astounded.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n184" class="calibre1">[184]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title">And the native land of these model families is the pattern Christian country for Europe; so
says at least Count Montalembert, certainly a competent authority on Christianity!

<a name="a185" class="calibre14" id="a185"></a></p>
<p class="title">Wages in the above industries, miserable as they are (the maximum <!--442-->wages
of a child in the straw-plait schools rising in rare cases to 3 shillings),
are reduced far below their nominal amount by the prevalence of the truck
system everywhere, but especially in the lace districts. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n185" class="calibre1">[185]</a></sup></p>

<h4 class="calibre15">E. Passage of Modern Manufacture, an Domestic Industry into Modern Mechanical Industry. The Hastening of This Revolution by the Application of the Factory Acts to those Industries</h4>

<p class="title">The cheapening of labour-power, by sheer abuse of the labour of women
and children, by sheer robbery of every normal condition requisite for
working and living, and by the sheer brutality of overwork and night-work,
meets at last with natural obstacles that cannot be overstepped. So also,
when based on these methods, do the cheapening of commodities and capitalist
exploitation in general. So soon as this point is at last reached — and
it takes many years — the hour has struck for the introduction of machinery,
and for the thenceforth rapid conversion of the scattered domestic industries
and also of manufactures into factory industries.
</p>
<p class="title">An example, on the most colossal scale, of this movement is afforded
by the production of wearing apparel. This industry, according to the classification
of the Children’s Employment Commission, comprises straw-hat makers, ladies’-hat
makers, cap-makers, tailors, milliners and dressmakers, shirt-makers, corset-makers,
glove-makers, shoemakers, besides many minor branches, such as the making
of neck-ties, collars, &amp;c. In 1861, the number of females employed
in these industries, in England and Wales, amounted to 586,299, of these
115,242 at the least were under 20, and 16,650. under 15 years of age.
The number of these workwomen in the United Kingdom in 1861, was 750,334.
The number of males employed in England and Wales, in hat-making, shoemaking,
glove-making and tailoring was 437,969; of these 14,964 under 15 years,
89,285 between 15 and 20, and 333,117 over 20 years. Many of the smaller
branches are not included in these figures. But take the figures as they
stand; we then have for England and Wales alone, according to the census
of 1861, a total of 1,024,277 persons, about as many as are absorbed by
agriculture and cattle breeding. We begin to understand what becomes of
the immense quantities of goods conjured up by the magic of machinery,
and of the enormous masses of workpeople, which that machinery sets free.

<a name="a186" class="calibre14" id="a186"></a></p>
<p class="title">The production of wearing apparel is carried on partly in manufactories
in whose workrooms there is but a reproduction of that division of
labour, the membra disjecta of which were found ready to hand; partly by
small master-handicraftsmen; these, however, do not, as formerly, work
for individual consumers, but for manufactories and warehouses, and to
such an extent that often whole towns and stretches of country carry on
certain branches, such as shoemaking, as a speciality; finally, on a very
great scale by the so-called domestic workers, who form an external department
of the manufactories, warehouses, and even of the workshops of the smaller
masters. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n186" class="calibre1">[186]</a></sup><a name="a187" class="calibre14" id="a187"></a></p>
<p class="title">The raw material, &amp;c., is supplied by mechanical industry,
the mass of cheap human material (taillable à merci et miséricorde)
is composed of the individuals “liberated” by mechanical industry and improved
agriculture. The manufactures of this class owed their origin chiefly to
the capitalist’s need of having at hand an army ready equipped to meet
any increase of demand. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n187" class="calibre1">[187]</a></sup> These manufactures, nevertheless, allowed the scattered handicrafts and domestic industries to continue to
exist as a broad foundation. The great production of surplus-value in these
branches of labour, and the progressive cheapening of their articles, were
and are chiefly due to the minimum wages paid, no more than requisite for
a miserable vegetation, and to the extension of working-time up to the
maximum endurable by the human organism. It was in fact by the cheapness
of the human sweat and the human blood, which were converted into commodities,
that the markets were constantly being extended, and continue daily to
be extended; more especially was this the case with England’s colonial
markets, where, besides, English tastes and habits prevail. At last the
critical point was reached. The basis of the old method, sheer brutality
in the exploitation of the workpeople, accompanied more or less by a systematic
division of labour, no longer sufficed for the extending markets and for
the still more rapidly extending competition of the capitalists. The hour
struck for the advent of machinery. The decisively revolutionary machine,
the machine which attacks in an equal degree the whole of the numberless
branches of this sphere of production, dressmaking, tailoring, shoemaking,
sewing, hat-making, and many others, is the sewing-machine.

<a name="a188" class="calibre14" id="a188"></a></p>
<p class="title">Its immediate effect on the workpeople is like that of all machinery,
which, since the rise of modern industry, has seized upon new branches
of trade. Children of too tender an age are sent adrift. The wage of the
machine hands rises compared with that of the house-workers, many <!--444-->of
whom belong to the poorest of the poor. That of the better situated handicraftsman,
with whom the machine competes, sinks. The new machine hands are exclusively
girls and young women. With the help of mechanical force, they destroy
the monopoly that male labour had of the heavier work, and they drive off
from the lighter work numbers of old women and very young children. The
overpowering <a name="a189" class="calibre14" id="a189"></a>competition crushes the weakest of the manual labourers. The
fearful increase in death from starvation during the last 10 years in London
runs parallel with the extension of machine sewing. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n188" class="calibre1">[188]</a></sup> The new workwomen turn the machines by hand and foot, or by hand alone, sometimes sitting, sometimes standing, according to the weight, size, and
special make of the machine, and expend a great deal of labour-power. Their
occupation is unwholesome, owing to the long hours, although in most cases
they are not so long as under the old system. Wherever the sewing-machine
locates itself in narrow and already over-crowded workrooms, it adds to
the unwholesome influences.</p>
<p class="title">  “The effect,” says Mr. Lord, “on entering low-ceiled
workrooms in which 30 to 40 machine hands are working is unbearable....
The heat, partly due to the gas stoves used for warming the irons, is horrible....
Even when moderate hours of work, i.e., from 8 in the morning till 6 in
the evening, prevail in such places, yet 3 or 4 persons fall into a swoon
regularly every day.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n189" class="calibre1">[189]</a></sup><a name="a190" class="calibre14" id="a190"></a></p>

<p class="title">The revolution in the industrial methods which is the necessary
result of the revolution in the instruments of production, is effected
by a medley of transition forms. These forms vary according to the extent
to which the sewing-machine has become prevalent in one branch, of industry
or the other, to the time during which it has been in operation, to the
previous condition of the workpeople, to the preponderance of manufacture,
of handicrafts or of domestic industry, to the rent of the workrooms, <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n190" class="calibre1">[190]</a></sup> &amp;c. In dressmaking, for instance, where the labour for the most part was already organised, chiefly by simple co-operation, the sewing-machine
at first formed merely a new factor in that manufacturing industry. In
tailoring, shirtmaking, shoemaking, &amp;c., all the forms are intermingled.
Here the factory system proper. There middlemen receive the raw material
from the capitalist <em class="calibre11">en chef</em>, and group around their sewing-machines,
in “chambers” and “garrets,” from 10 to 50 or more workwomen. <a name="a191" class="calibre14" id="a191"></a><a name="a192" class="calibre14" id="a192"></a>Finally, as is always the case with machinery when not organised into a system,
and when it can also be used in dwarfish proportions, handicraftsman and
domestic workers, along with their families, or with a little extra labour
from without, make use of their own sewing-machines. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n191" class="calibre1">[191]</a></sup> The system actually prevalent in England is, that the capitalist concentrates a large number of machines on his premises, and then distributes the produce
of those machines for further manipulation amongst the domestic workers.
<sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n192" class="calibre1">[192]</a></sup> The variety of the transition forms, however,
does not conceal the tendency to conversion into the factory system proper.
This tendency is nurtured by the very nature of the sewing-machine, the
manifold uses of which push on the concentration, under one roof, and one
management, of previously separated branches of a trade. It is also favoured
by the circumstance that preparatory needlework, <a name="a193" class="calibre14" id="a193"></a><a name="a194" class="calibre14" id="a194"></a>and certain other operations, are most conveniently done on the premises where the machine is at work; as well as by the inevitable expropriation of the hand sewers, and of the
domestic workers who work with their own machines. This fate has already
in part overtaken them. The constantly increasing amount of capital invested
in sewing-machines, <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n193" class="calibre1">[193]</a></sup> gives the spur to the production of, and gluts the markets with, machine-made articles, thereby giving the
signal to the domestic workers for the sale of their machines. The overproduction
of sewing-machines themselves, causes their producers, in bad want of a
sale, to let them out for so much a week, thus crushing by their deadly
competition the small owners of machines. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n194" class="calibre1">[194]</a></sup> Constant changes in the construction of the machines, and their ever-increasing
cheapness, depreciate day by day the older makes, and allow of their being
sold in great numbers, at absurd prices, to large capitalists, who alone
can thus employ them at a profit. Finally, the substitution of the steam-engine
for man gives in this, as in all similar revolutions, the finishing blow.
At first, the use of steam power meets with mere technical difficulties,
such as unsteadiness in the machines, difficulty <a name="a195" class="calibre14" id="a195"></a><a name="a196" class="calibre14" id="a196"></a>in controlling their speed, rapid wear and tear of the lighter machines, &amp;c., all of which are
soon overcome by experience. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n195" class="calibre1">[195]</a></sup> If, on the one hand, the concentration of many machines in large manufactories leads to the
use of steam power, on the other hand, the competition of steam
with human muscles hastens on the concentration of workpeople and machines
in large factories. Thus England is at present experiencing, not only in
the colossal industry of making wearing apparel, but in most of the other
trades mentioned above, the conversion of manufacture, of handicrafts,
and of domestic work into the factory system, after each of those forms
of production, totally changed and disorganised. under the Influence of
modern industry, has long ago reproduced, and even overdone, all the horrors
of the factory system, without participating in any of the elements of
social progress it contains. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n196" class="calibre1">[196]</a></sup><a name="a197" class="calibre14" id="a197"></a>
<a name="a198" class="calibre14" id="a198"></a></p>
<p class="title">This industrial revolution which takes place spontaneously, is
artificially helped on by the extension of the Factory Acts to all industries
in which women, young persons and children are employed. The compulsory
regulation of the working-day as regards its length, pauses, beginning
and end, the system of relays of children, the exclusion of all children
under a certain age, &amp;c., necessitate on the one hand more machinery
<sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n197" class="calibre1">[197]</a></sup> and the substitution of steam as a motive power in the place of muscles. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n198" class="calibre1">[198]</a></sup> On the other hand, in order to make up for the loss of time, an expansion occurs of the means
of production used in common, of the furnaces, buildings, &amp;c., in one
word, greater concentration of the means of production and a correspondingly
greater concourse of workpeople. The chief objection, repeatedly and passionately
urged on behalf of each manufacture threatened with the Factory Act, is
in fact this, that in order to continue the business on the old scale a
greater outlay of capital will be necessary. But as regards labour in the
so-called domestic industries and the intermediate forms between them and
Manufacture, so soon as limits are put to the working-day and to the employment
of children, those industries go to the wall. Unlimited exploitation
of cheap labour-power is the sole foundation of their power to compete.
</p>
<p class="title">One of the essential conditions for the existence of the factory
system, especially when the length of the working-day is fixed, is certainty
in the result, i.e., the production in a given time of a given quantity
of commodities, or of a given useful effect. The statutory pauses in the
working-day, moreover, imply the assumption that periodical and sudden
cessation of the work does no harm to the article undergoing the process
of production. This certainty in the result, and this possibility of interrupting
the work are, of course, easier to be attained in the purely mechanical
industries than in those in which chemical and physical processes play
a part; as, for instance, in the earthenware trade, in bleaching, dyeing,
baking, and in most of the metal industries. Wherever there is a workingday
without restriction as to length, wherever there is night-work and unrestricted
waste of human life, there the slightest obstacle presented by the nature
of the work to a change for the better is soon looked upon as an everlasting
barrier erected by Nature. No poison kills vermin with more certainty than
the Factory Act removes such everlasting barriers. No one made a greater
outcry over “impossibilities” than our friends the earthenware manufacturers.
In 1864, however, they were brought under the Act, and within sixteen months
every “impossibility” had vanished.</p>
<p class="title">  “The improved method,” called forth
by the Act, “of making slip by pressure instead of by evaporation, the
newly-constructed stoves for drying the ware in its green state, &amp;c.,
are each events of great importance in the pottery art, and mark an advance
which the preceding century could not rival.... <a name="a199" class="calibre14" id="a199"></a><a name="a200" class="calibre14" id="a200"></a>It has even considerably reduced the temperature of the stoves themselves with a considerable saving
of fuel, and with a readier effect on the ware.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n199" class="calibre1">[199]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title"> In spite of every prophecy, the cost-price of earthenware did not rise, but the quantity produced did, and to such an extent that the export for
the twelve months, ending December, 1865, exceeded in value by £138,628
the average of the preceding three years. In the manufacture of matches
it was thought to be an indispensable requirement, that boys, even while
bolting their dinner, should go on dipping the matches in melted phosphorus,
the poisonous vapour from which rose into their faces. The Factory Act
(1864) made the saving of time a necessity, and so forced into existence
a dipping machine, the vapour from which could not come in contact with
the workers. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n200" class="calibre1">[200]</a></sup> So, at the present time, in those branches of the lace <!--448-->manufacture not yet subject to the Factory
Act, it is maintained that the meal-times cannot be regular owing to the
different periods required by the various kinds of lace for drying, which
periods vary from three minutes up to an hour and more. To this the Children’s
Employment Commissioners answer:</p>
<p class="title">  “The circumstances of this case are precisely
analogous to that of the paper-stainers, dealt with in our first report.
Some of the principal manufacturers in the trade urged that in consequence
of the nature of the materials used, and their various processes, they
would be unable, without serious loss, to stop for meal-times at any given
moment. But it was seen from the evidence that, by due care and previous
arrangement, the apprehended difficulty would be got over; and accordingly,
by clause <a name="a201" class="calibre14" id="a201"></a><a name="a202" class="calibre14" id="a202"></a>6 of section 6 of the Factory Acts Extension Act, passed during this Session of Parliament, an interval of eighteen months is given to
them from the passing of the Act before they are required to conform to
the meal hours, specified by the Factory Acts.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n201" class="calibre1">[201]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title"> Hardly had the Act been passed when our friends the manufacturers found out:</p>
<p class="title">  “The inconveniences we expected to arise from the introduction of
the Factory Acts into our branch of manufacture, I am happy to say, have
not arisen. We do not find the production at all interfered with; in short,
we produce more in the same time.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n202" class="calibre1">[202]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title">It is evident that the English legislature, which certainly no one will venture to reproach
with being overdosed with genius, has been led by experience to the conclusion
that a simple compulsory law is sufficient to enact away all the so-called
impediments, opposed by the nature of the process, to the restriction and
regulation of the working-day. Hence, on the introduction of the Factory
Act into a given industry, a period varying from six to eighteen months
is fixed within which it is incumbent on the manufacturers to remove all
technical impediments to the working of the Act. <a name="a203" class="calibre14" id="a203"></a>Mirabeau’s “Impossible!
ne me dites jamais ce bête de mot!” is particularly applicable to
modern technology. But though the Factory Acts thus artificially ripen
the material elements necessary for the conversion of the manufacturing
system into the factory system, yet at the same time, owing to the necessity
they impose for greater outlay of capital, they hasten on the decline of
the small masters, and the concentration of capital. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n203" class="calibre1">[203]</a></sup><a name="a204" class="calibre14" id="a204"></a></p>
<p class="title">Besides the purely technical impediments that are removable
by technical means, the irregular habits of the workpeople themselves obstruct
the regulation of the hours of labour. This is especially the case where
piece-wage predominates, and where loss of time in one part of the day
or week can be made good by subsequent over-time, or by night-work, a process
which brutalises the adult workman, and ruins his wife and children. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n204" class="calibre1">[204]</a></sup> Although this absence of regularity in the expenditure of labour-power is a natural and rude reaction against the tedium of monotonous drudgery,
it originates, also, to a much greater degree from anarchy in production,
anarchy that in its turn pre-supposes unbridled exploitation of labour-power
by the capitalist. Besides the general periodic changes of the industrial
cycle, and the special fluctuations in the markets to which each industry
is subject, we may also reckon what is called “the season,” dependent either
on the periodicity of favourable seasons of the year for navigation; or
on fashion, and the sudden placing of large orders that have to be executed
in the shortest possible time. The habit of giving such orders becomes
more frequent with the extension of railways and telegraphs.</p>
<p class="title">  “The extension of the railway system throughout the country 
<a name="a205" class="calibre14" id="a205"></a>has tended very much to encourage
giving short notice. Purchasers now come up from Glasgow, Manchester, and
Edinburgh once every fortnight or so to the wholesale city warehouses which
we supply, and give small orders requiring immediate execution, instead
of buying from stock as they used to do. Years ago we were always able
to work in the slack times, so as to meet demand of the next season, but
now no one can say beforehand what will be the demand then.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n205" class="calibre1">[205]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title">In those factories and manufactories that are not yet subject
to the Factory Acts, the most fearful over-work prevails periodically during
what is called the season, in consequence of sudden orders. In the outside
department of the factory, of the manufactory, and of the warehouse,
the so-called domestic workers, whose employment is at the best irregular,
are entirely dependent for their raw material and their orders on the caprice
of the capitalist, who, in this industry, is not hampered by any regard
for depreciation of his buildings and machinery, and risks nothing by a
stoppage of work, but the skin of the worker himself. Here then he sets
himself systematically to work to form an industrial reserve force that
shall be ready at a moment’s notice; during one part of the year he decimates
this force by the most inhuman toil, during the other part, he lets it
starve for want of work. <a name="a206" class="calibre14" id="a206"></a><a name="a207" class="calibre14" id="a207"></a></p>
<p class="title"> “The employers avail themselves of the habitual irregularity 
in the homework, when any extra work is wanted at a push,
so that the work goes on till 11, and 12 p.m. or 2 a.m., or as the usual
phrase is, “all hours,” and that in localities where “the stench is enough
to knock you down, you go to the door, perhaps, and open it, but shudder
to go further.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n206" class="calibre1">[206]</a></sup> “They are curious men,” said
one of the witnesses, a shoemaker, speaking of the masters, “they think
it does a boy no harm to work too hard for half the year, if he is nearly
idle for the other half.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n207" class="calibre1">[207]</a></sup><a name="a208" class="calibre14" id="a208"></a>
<a name="a208a" class="calibre14" id="a208a"></a>
<a name="a208b" class="calibre14" id="a208b"></a>
<a name="a209" class="calibre14" id="a209"></a></p>

<p class="title">In the same way as technical impediments, so, too, those “usages
which have grown with the growth of trade” were and still are proclaimed
by interested capitalists as obstacles due to the nature of the work. This
was a favourite cry of the cotton lords at the time they were first threatened
with the Factory Acts. Although their industry more than any other depends
on navigation, yet experience has given them the lie. Since then, every
pretended obstruction to business has been treated by the Factory inspectors
as a mere sham. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n208" class="calibre1">[208]</a></sup> The thoroughly conscientious
investigations of the Children’s Employment Commission prove that the effect
of the regulation of the hours of work, in some industries, was to spread
the mass of labour previously employed more evenly over the whole year
<sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n208a" class="calibre1">[208a]</a></sup> that this regulation was the first rational
bridle on the murderous, meaningless caprices of fashion, <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n208b" class="calibre1">[208b]</a></sup> caprices that <!--451-->consort so badly with the system of modern industry; that the development of ocean navigation and of the means of communication
generally, has swept <a name="a210" class="calibre14" id="a210"></a><a name="a211" class="calibre14" id="a211"></a><a name="a212" class="calibre14" id="a212"></a>away the technical basis on which season-work was really supported, <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n209" class="calibre1">[209]</a></sup> and that all other so-called unconquerable difficulties vanish before larger buildings, additional machinery, increase in the number of workpeople employed, <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n210" class="calibre1">[210]</a></sup> and the alterations caused by all these in the mode of conducting the wholesale trade. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n211" class="calibre1">[211]</a></sup> But for all that, capital never becomes reconciled to such changes — and this is admitted over and over again by its own representatives — except “under the pressure of a General Act
of Parliament” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n212" class="calibre1">[212]</a></sup> for the compulsory regulation
of the hours of labour.

<hr class="end1"/><h3 id="calibre_toc_81" class="calibre17">SECTION 9 - THE FACTORY ACTS. SANITARY AND EDUCATIONAL CLAUSES OF THE SAME. THEIR GENERAL EXTENSION IN ENGLAND</h3>

<hr class="end1"/><p class="title">Factory legislation, that first conscious and methodical
reaction of society against the spontaneously developed form of the process
of production, is, as we have seen, just as much the necessary product
of modern industry as cotton yarn, self-actors, and the electric telegraph.
Before passing to the consideration of the extension of that legislation
in England, we shall shortly notice certain clauses contained in the Factory
Acts, and not relating to the hours of work.
</p>
<p class="title">Apart from their wording, which makes it easy for the capitalist
to evade them, the sanitary clauses are extremely meagre, and, in fact, <!--452-->limited
to provisions for whitewashing the walls, for insuring cleanliness in some
other matters, for ventilation, and for protection against dangerous machinery.
In the third book we shall return again to the fanatical opposition of
the masters to those clauses which imposed upon them a slight expenditure
on appliances for protecting the limbs of their workpeople, an opposition
that throws a fresh and glaring light on the Free-trade dogma, according
to which, in a society with conflicting interests, each individual necessarily
furthers the common weal by seeking nothing but his own personal advantage!
One example is enough. The reader knows that during the last 20 years,
the flax industry has very much extended, and that, with that extension,
the number of scutching mills in Ireland has increased. In 1864 there were
in that country 1,800 of these mills. Regularly in autumn and winter women
and “young persons,” the wives, sons, and daughters of the neighbouring
small farmers, a class of people totally unaccustomed to machinery, are
taken from field labour to feed the rollers of the scutching mills with
flax. The accidents, both as regards number and kind, are wholly unexampled
in the history of machinery. In one scutching mill, at Kildinan, near Cork,
there occurred between 1852 and 1856, six fatal accidents and sixty mutilations;
every one of which might have been prevented by the simplest appliances,
at the cost of a few shillings. <a name="a213" class="calibre14" id="a213"></a>Dr. W. White, the certifying surgeon for
factories at Downpatrick, states in his official report, dated the 15th
December, 1865:</p>
<p class="title">  “The serious accidents at the scutching mills are of the
most fearful nature. In many cases a quarter of the body is torn from the
trunk, and either involves death, or a future of wretched incapacity and
suffering. The increase of mills in the country will, of course, extend
these dreadful results, and it will be a great boon if they are brought
under the legislature. I am convinced that by proper supervision of scutching
mills a vast sacrifice of life and limb would be averted.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n213" class="calibre1">[213]</a></sup><a name="a214" class="calibre14" id="a214"></a></p>

<p class="title">What could possibly show better the character of the capitalist
mode of production, than the necessity that exists for forcing upon it,
by Acts of Parliament, the simplest appliances for maintaining cleanliness
and health? In the potteries the Factory Act of 1864 “has whitewashed and
cleansed upwards of 200 workshops, after a period of abstinence from any
such cleaning, in many cases of 20 years, and in some, entirely,” (this
is the “abstinence” of the capitalist!) “in which were employed 27,800
artisans, hitherto breathing through protracted days and often nights of
labour, a mephitic atmosphere, and which rendered an otherwise comparatively
innocuous occupation, pregnant with disease and <!--453-->death. The Act
has improved the ventilation very much.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n214" class="calibre1">[214]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title">At the same time, this portion of the Act strikingly shows that the capitalist
mode of production, owing to its very nature, excludes all rational improvement
beyond a certain point. It has been stated over and over again that the
English doctors are unanimous in declaring that where the work is continuous,
500 cubic feet is the very least space that should be allowed for each
person. Now, if the Factory Acts, owing to their compulsory provisions,
indirectly hasten on the conversion of small workshops into factories,
thus indirectly attacking the proprietary rights of the smaller capitalists,
and assuring a monopoly to the great ones, so, if it were made obligatory
to provide the proper space for each workman in every workshop, thousands
of small <a name="a215" class="calibre14" id="a215"></a>employers would, at one full swoop, be expropriated directly!
The very root of the capitalist mode of production, i.e., the self-expansion
of all capital, large or small, by means of the “free” purchase and consumption
of labour-power, would be attacked. Factory legislation is therefore brought
to a deadlock before these 500 cubic feet of breathing space. The sanitary
officers, the industrial inquiry commissioners, the factory inspectors,
all harp, over and over again, upon the necessity for those 500 cubic feet,
and upon the impossibility of wringing them out of capital. They thus,
in fact, declare that consumption and other lung diseases among the workpeople
are necessary conditions to the existence of capital. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n215" class="calibre1">[215]</a></sup><a name="a216" class="calibre14" id="a216"></a>
<a name="a217" class="calibre14" id="a217"></a>
<a name="a218" class="calibre14" id="a218"></a></p>
<p class="title">Paltry as the education clauses of the Act appear on the whole,
yet they proclaim elementary education to be an indispensable condition
to the employment of children. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n216" class="calibre1">[216]</a></sup> The success of
those clauses proved for the first time the possibility of combining education
and gymnastics <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n217" class="calibre1">[217]</a></sup><!--454-->with manual labour,
and, consequently, of combining manual labour with education and gymnastics.
The factory inspectors soon found out by questioning the schoolmasters,
that the factory children, although receiving only one half the education
of the regular day scholars, yet learnt quite as much and often more.</p>
<p class="title">  “This can be accounted for by the simple fact that, with only being at school
for one half of the day, they are always fresh, and nearly always ready
and willing to receive instruction. The system on which they work, half
manual labour, and half school, renders each employment a rest and a relief
to the other; consequently, both are far more congenial to the child, than
would <a name="a219" class="calibre14" id="a219"></a>be the case were he kept constantly at one. It is quite clear that
a boy who has been at school all the morning, cannot (in hot weather particularly)
cope with one who comes fresh and bright from his work.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n218" class="calibre1">[218]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title">Further information on this point will be found in Senior’s speech at the Social Science 
Congress at Edinburgh in 1863. He there shows, amongst other
things, how the monotonous and uselessly long school hours of the children
of the upper and middle classes, uselessly add to the labour of the teacher,
 “while he not only fruitlessly but absolutely injuriously, wastes the time,
health, and energy of the children.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n219" class="calibre1">[219]</a></sup> From the
Factory system budded, as Robert Owen has shown us in detail, the germ
of the education of the future, an education that will, in the case of
every child over a given age, combine productive labour with instruction
and gymnastics, not only as one of the methods of adding to the efficiency
of production, but as the only method of producing fully developed human
beings.

<a name="a220" class="calibre14" id="a220"></a></p>
<p class="title">Modern industry, as we have seen, sweeps away by technical means
the manufacturing division of labour, under which each man is bound hand
and foot for life to a single detail-operation. At the same time, the <!--455-->capitalistic
form of that industry reproduces this same division of labour in a still
more monstrous shape; in the factory proper, by converting the workman
into a living appendage of the machine; and everywhere outside the Factory,
partly by the sporadic use of machinery and machine workers, <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n220" class="calibre1">[220]</a></sup> partly by re-establishing the division of labour on a fresh basis by the general introduction of the labour of women and children, and of cheap unskilled labour.
</p>
<p class="title">The antagonism between the manufacturing division of labour and
the methods of modern industry makes itself forcibly felt. It manifests
itself, amongst other ways, in the frightful fact that a great part of
the children employed in modern factories and manufactures, are from their
earliest years riveted to the most simple manipulations, and exploited
for years, without being taught a single sort of work that would afterwards
make them of use, even in the same manufactory or factory. In the English
letter-press printing trade, for example, there existed formerly a system,
corresponding to that in the old manufactures and handicrafts, of advancing
the apprentices from easy to more and more difficult work. They went through
a course of teaching till they were finished printers. To be able to read
and write was for every one of them a requirement of their trade. All this
was changed by the printing machine. It employs two sorts of labourers,
one grown up, renters, the other, boys mostly from 11 to 17 years of age
whose sole business is either to spread the sheets of paper under the machine,
or to take from it the printed sheets. <a name="a221" class="calibre14" id="a221"></a><a name="a222" class="calibre14" id="a222"></a>They perform this weary task, in London especially, for 14, 15, and 16 hours at a stretch, during several
days in the week, and frequently for 36 hours, with only 2 hours’ rest
for meals and sleep. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n221" class="calibre1">[221]</a></sup> A great part of them cannot read, and they are, as a rule, utter savages and very extraordinary creatures.</p>
<p class="title"> “To qualify them for the work which they have to do, they require no intellectual
training; there is little room in it for skill, and less for judgment;
their wages, though rather high for boys, do not increase proportionately
as they grow up, and the majority of them cannot look for advancement to
the better paid and <!--456-->more responsible post of machine minder,
because while each machine has but one minder, it has at least two, and
often four boys attached to it.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n222" class="calibre1">[222]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title">As soon as they get too old for such child’s work, that is about 17 at the latest, they
are discharged from the printing establishments. They become recruits of
crime. Several attempts to procure them employment elsewhere, were rendered
of no avail by their ignorance and brutality, and by their mental and bodily
degradation.

<a name="a223" class="calibre14" id="a223"></a></p>
<p class="title">As with the division of labour in the interior of the manufacturing
workshops, so it is with the division of labour in the interior of society.
So long as handicraft and manufacture form the general groundwork of social
production, the subjection of the producer to one branch exclusively, the
breaking up of the multifariousness of his employment, <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n223" class="calibre1">[223]</a></sup> is a necessary step in the development. On that groundwork each separate branch of production acquires empirically the form that is technically
suited to it, slowly perfects it, and, so soon as a given degree of maturity
has been reached, rapidly crystallises that form. The only thing, that
here and there causes a change, besides new raw material supplied by commerce,
is the gradual alteration of the instruments of labour. But their form,
too, once definitely <a name="a224" class="calibre14" id="a224"></a>settled by experience, petrifies, as is proved by
their being in many cases handed down in the same form by one generation
to another during thousands of years. A characteristic feature is, that,
even down into the eighteenth century, the different trades were called
 “mysteries” (mystères); <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n224" class="calibre1">[224]</a></sup> into their secrets none but those duly initiated could penetrate. modern industry rent the
veil that concealed from men their own social process of production, and
that turned the various, spontaneously divided branches of production into
so many riddles, not only to outsiders, but even to the initiated. The
principle which it pursued, of resolving each process into its constituent
movements, without any regard to their possible execution by the hand of
man, created the new modern science of technology. The varied, apparently
unconnected, and petrified forms of the industri<!--457-->al processes now
resolved themselves into so many conscious and systematic applications
of natural science to the attainment of given useful effects. Technology
also discovered the few main fundamental forms of motion, which, despite
the diversity of the instruments used, are necessarily taken by every productive
action of the human body; just as the science of mechanics sees in the
most complicated machinery nothing but the continual repetition of the
simple mechanical powers.

<a name="a225" class="calibre14" id="a225"></a></p>
<p class="title">modern industry never looks upon and treats the existing form
of a process as final. The technical basis of that industry is therefore
revolutionary, while all earlier modes of production were essentially conservative.
<sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n225" class="calibre1">[225]</a></sup> By means of machinery, chemical processes and
other methods, it is continually causing changes not only in the technical
basis of production, but also in the functions of the labourer, and in
the social combinations of the labour-process. At the same time, it thereby
also revolutionises the division of labour within the society, and incessantly
launches masses of capital and of workpeople from one branch of production
to another. But if modern industry, by its very nature, therefore necessitates
variation of labour, fluency of function, universal mobility of the labourer,
on the other hand, in its capitalistic form, it reproduces the old division
of labour with its ossified particularisations. <a name="a226" class="calibre14" id="a226"></a>We have seen how this absolute
contradiction between the technical necessities of modern industry, and
the social character inherent in its capitalistic form, dispels all fixity
and security in the situation of the labourer; how it constantly threatens,
by taking away the instruments of labour, to snatch from his hands his
means of subsistence, <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n226" class="calibre1">[226]</a></sup> and, by suppressing his
detail-function, to make him superfluous, We have seen, too, how this antagonism
vents its rage in the creation of that monstrosity, an industrial reserve
army, kept in misery in order to <a name="a227" class="calibre14" id="a227"></a>be always at the disposal of capital;
in the incessant human sacrifices from among the working-class, in the
most reckless squandering of labour-power and in the devastation caused
by a social anarchy which turns every <!--458-->economic progress into
a social calamity. This is the negative side. But if, on the one hand,
variation of work at present imposes itself after the manner of an overpowering
natural law, and with the blindly destructive action of a natural law that
meets with resistance <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n227" class="calibre1">[227]</a></sup> at all points, modern industry, on the other hand, through its catastrophes imposes the necessity of recognising,
as a fundamental law of production, variation of work, consequently fitness
of the labourer for varied work, consequently the greatest possible development
of his varied aptitudes. It becomes a question of life and death for society
to adapt the mode of production to the normal functioning of this law.
modern industry, indeed, compels society, under penalty of death, to replace
the detail-worker of to-day, grappled by life-long repetition of one and
the same trivial operation, and thus reduced to the mere fragment of a
man, by the fully developed individual, fit for a variety of labours, ready
to face any change of production, and to whom the different social functions
he performs, are but so many modes of giving free scope to his own natural
and acquired powers.
</p>
<p class="title">One step already spontaneously taken towards effecting this revolution
is the establishment of technical and agricultural schools, and of “écoles
d’enseignement professionnel,” in which the children of the working-men
receive some little instruction in technology and in the practical handling
of the various implements of labour. <a name="a228" class="calibre14" id="a228"></a>Though the Factory Act, that first
and meagre concession wrung from capital, is limited to combining elementary
education with work in the factory, there can be no doubt that when the
working-class comes into power, as inevitably it must, technical instruction,
both theoretical and practical, will take its proper place in the working-class
schools. There is also no doubt that such revolutionary ferments, the final
result of which is the abolition of the old division of labour, are diametrically
opposed to the capitalistic form of production, and to the economic status
of the labourer corresponding to that form. But the historical development
of the antagonisms, immanent in a given form of production, is the only
way in which that form of production can be dissolved and a new form established.
 “Ne sutor ultra crepidam” — this nec plus ultra of handicraft wisdom became
sheer nonsense, from the moment the watchmaker Watt invented the steam-engine,
the barber Arkwright, the throstle, and the working-jeweller, Fulton, the
steamship. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n228" class="calibre1">[228]</a></sup><a name="a229" class="calibre14" id="a229"></a></p>
<p class="title">So long as Factory legislation is confined to regulating the labour
in factories, manufactories, &amp;c., it is regarded as a mere interference
with the exploiting rights of capital. But when it comes to regulating
the so-called “home-labour,” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n229" class="calibre1">[229]</a></sup> it is immediately viewed as a direct attack on the patria potestas, on parental authority.
The tender-hearted English Parliament long affected to shrink from taking
this step. The force of facts, however, compelled it at last to acknowledge
that modern industry, in overturning the economic foundation on which was
based the traditional family, and the family labour corresponding to it,
had also unloosened all traditional family ties. The rights of the children
had to be proclaimed. The final report of the Ch. Empl. Comm. of 1866,
states:</p>
<p class="title">  “It is unhappily, to a painful degree, apparent throughout the
whole of the evidence, that against no persons do the children of both
sexes so much require protection as against their parents.” The system
of unlimited exploitation of children’s labour in general and the so-called
home-labour in particular is <a name="a230" class="calibre14" id="a230"></a>"maintained only because the parents are able,
without check or control, to exercise this arbitrary and mischievous power
over their young and tender offspring.... Parents must not possess the
absolute power of making their children mere ‘machines to earn so much
weekly wage....’ The children and young persons, therefore, in all such
cases may justifiably claim from the legislature, as a natural right, that
an exemption should be secured to them, from what destroys prematurely
their physical strength, and lowers them in the scale of intellectual and
moral beings.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n230" class="calibre1">[230]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title">It was not, however, the misuse of parental authority that created the capitalistic exploitation, whether
direct or indirect, of children’s labour; but, on the contrary, it was
the capitalistic mode of exploitation which, by sweeping away <!--460-->the
economic basis of parental authority, made its exercise degenerate into
a mischievous misuse of power. However terrible and disgusting the dissolution,
under the capitalist system, of the old family ties may appear, nevertheless,
modern industry, by assigning as it does an important part in the process
of production, outside the domestic sphere, to women, to young persons,
and to children of both sexes, creates a new economic foundation for a
higher form of the family and of the relations between the sexes. It is,
of course, just as absurd to hold the Teutonic-Christian form of the family
to be absolute and final as it would be to apply that character to the
ancient Roman, the ancient Greek, or the <a name="a231" class="calibre14" id="a231"></a>Eastern forms which, moreover,
taken together form a series in historical development. Moreover, it is
obvious that the fact of the collective working group being composed of
individuals of both sexes and all ages, must necessarily, under suitable
conditions, become a source of humane development; although in its spontaneously
developed, brutal, capitalistic form, where the labourer exists for the
process of production, and not the process of production for the labourer,
that fact is a pestiferous source of corruption and slavery. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n231" class="calibre1">[231]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title">The necessity for a generalisation of the Factory Acts, for transforming
them from an exceptional law relating to mechanical spinning and weaving
— those first creations of machinery — into a law affecting social production
as a whole, arose, as we have seen, from the mode in which modern industry
was historically developed. In the rear of that industry, the traditional
form of manufacture, of handicraft, and of domestic industry, is entirely
revolutionised; manufactures are constantly passing into the factory system,
and handicrafts into manufactures; and lastly, <a name="a232" class="calibre14" id="a232"></a><a name="a233" class="calibre14" id="a233"></a>the spheres of handicraft and of the domestic industries become, in a, comparatively speaking, wonderfully
short time, dens of misery in which capitalistic exploitation obtains free
play for the wildest excesses. There are two circumstances that finally
turn the scale: first, the constantly recurring experience that capital,
so soon as it finds itself subject to legal control at one point, compensates
itself all the more recklessly at other points; <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n232" class="calibre1">[232]</a></sup> secondly, the cry of the capitalists for equality in the conditions of competition, i.e., for equal restrain on all exploitation of labour. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n233" class="calibre1">[233]</a></sup> On this point let us listen to two heart-broken cries. Messrs. Cooksley of <a name="a234" class="calibre14" id="a234"></a><a name="a235" class="calibre14" id="a235"></a>Bristol, nail and chain, &amp;c., manufacturers, spontaneously introduced the regulations of the Factory Act into their business.</p>
<p class="title">  “As the old irregular system prevails in neighbouring works, the Messrs. Cooksley are subject
to the disadvantage of having their boys enticed to continue their labour
elsewhere after 6 p.m. ‘This,’ they naturally say, ‘is an unjustice and
loss to us, as it exhausts a portion of the boy’s strength, of which we
ought to have the full benefit’.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n234" class="calibre1">[234]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title">Mr. J. Simpson (paper box and bagmaker, London) states before the commissioners of the
Ch. Empl. Comm.:</p>
<p class="title">  “He would sign any petition for it” (legislative interference)... “As it was, he always felt restless at night, when he had closed his place,
lest others should be working later than him and getting away his orders.” 
 <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n235" class="calibre1">[235]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title">Summarising, the Ch. Empl. Comm. says:</p>
<p class="title">  “It would be unjust to the larger employers that their factories should be placed
under regulation, <a name="a236" class="calibre14" id="a236"></a>while the hours of labour in the smaller places in their
own branch of business were under no legislative restriction. And to the
injustice arising from the unfair conditions of competition, in regard
to hours, that would be created if the smaller places of work were exempt,
would be added the disadvantage to the larger manufacturers, of finding
their supply of juvenile and female labour drawn off to the places of work
exempt from legislation. Further, a stimulus would be given to the multiplication
of the smaller places of work, which are almost invariably the least favourable
to the health, comfort, education, and general improvement of the people.” 
 <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n236" class="calibre1">[236]</a></sup><a name="a237" class="calibre14" id="a237"></a></p>

<p class="title">In its final report the Commission proposes to subject to the
Factory Act more than 1,400,000 children, young persons, and women, of
which number about one half are exploited in small industries and by the
so-called home-work. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n237" class="calibre1">[237]</a></sup> It says,</p>
<p class="title">  “But if it should seem fit to Parliament to place the whole of that large number of children,
young persons and females under the protective legislation above adverted
to ... it cannot be doubted that such legislation would have a most beneficent
effect, not only upon the young and the feeble, who are its more immediate
objects, but upon the still larger body of adult workers, who would in
all these employments, both directly and indirectly, come immediately <!--462-->under
its influence. It would enforce upon them regular and moderate hours; it
would lead to their places of work being kept in a healthy and cleanly
state; it would therefore husband and improve that store of physical strength
on which their own well-being and that of <a name="a238" class="calibre14" id="a238"></a>the country so much depends;
it would save the rising generation from that overexertion at an early
age which undermines their constitutions and leads to premature decay;
finally, it would ensure them — at least up to the age of 13 — the opportunity
of receiving the elements of education, and would put an end to that utter
ignorance ... so faithfully exhibited in the Reports of our Assistant Commissioners,
and which cannot be regarded without the deepest pain, and a profound sense
of national degradation.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n238" class="calibre1">[238]</a></sup><a name="a239" class="calibre14" id="a239"></a>

<p class="title">The Tory Cabinet <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n239" class="calibre1">[239]</a></sup> announced in the Speech
from the Throne, on February 5, 1867, that it had framed the proposals
of the Industrial Commission of Inquiry <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n240" class="calibre1">[240]</a></sup> into
Bills. To get that far, another twenty years of <em class="calibre11">experimentum in corpore
vili</em> had been required. Already in 1840 a Parliamentary Commission
of Inquiry on the labour of children had been appointed. Its Report, in
1842, unfolded, in the words of Nassau W. Senior,</p>
<p class="title">  “the most frightful picture
of avarice, selfishness and cruelty on the part of masters and of parents,
and of juvenile and infantile misery, degradation and destruction ever
presented.... It may be supposed that it describes the horrors of a past
age. But there is unhappily evidence that those horrors continue as intense
as they were. A pamphlet published by Hardwicke about 2 years ago states
that the abuses complained of in 1842, are in full bloom at the present
day. It is a strange proof of the general neglect of the morals and health
of the children of the working-class, that this report lay unnoticed for
20 years, during which the children, ‘bred up without the remotest sign
of comprehension as to what is meant by the term morals, who had neither
knowledge, nor religion, nor natural affection,’ were allowed to become
the parents of the present generation.” <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n241" class="calibre1">[241]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title">The social conditions having undergone a change, Parliament could
not venture to shelve the demands of the Commission of 1862, as it <!--463-->had
done those of the Commission of 1840. Hence in 1864, when the Commission
had not yet published more than a part of its reports, the earthenware
industries (including the potteries), makers of paperhangings, matches,
cartridges, and caps, and fustian cutters were made subject to the Acts
in force in the textile industries. In the Speech from the Throne, on 5th
February, 1867, the Tory Cabinet of the day announced the introduction
of Bills, founded on the final recommendations of the Commission, which
had completed its labours in 1866.
</p>
<p class="title">On the 15th August, 1867, the Factory Acts Extension Act, and
on the 21st August, the Workshops’ Regulation Act received the Royal Assent;
the former Act having reference to large industries, the latter to small.
</p>
<p class="title">The former applies to blast-furnaces, iron’ and copper mills,
foundries, machine shops, metal manufactories, gutta-percha works, paper
mills, glass-works, tobacco manufactories, letter-press printing (including
newspapers), book-binding, in short to all industrial establishments of
the above kind, in which 50 individuals or more are occupied simultaneously,
and for not less than 100 days during the year.
</p>
<p class="title">To give an idea of the extent of the sphere embraced by the Workshops’
Regulation Act in its application, we cite from its interpretation clause,
the following passages:</p>
<p class="title"> “<em class="calibre11">Handicraft</em> shall mean any manual labour exercised by way
of trade, or for purposes of gain in, or incidental to, the making any
article or part of an article, or in, or incidental to, the altering, repairing,
ornamenting, finishing, or otherwise adapting for sale any article.” </p>
<p class="title"> “<em class="calibre11">Workshop</em> shall mean any room or place whatever in the
open air or undercover, in which any handicraft is carried on by any child,
young person, or woman, and to which and over which the person by whom
such child, young person, or woman is employed, has the right of access
and control.” </p>
<p class="title"> “<em class="calibre11">Employed</em> shall mean occupied in any handicraft, whether
for wages or not, under a master or under a parent as herein defined.” </p>
<p class="title"> “<em class="calibre11">Parent</em> shall mean parent, guardian, or person, having
the custody of, or control over, any... child or young person.” 
 </p>
<p class="title">Clause 7, which imposes a penalty for employment of children,
young persons, and women, contrary to the provisions of the Act, subjects
to fines, not only the occupier of the workshop, whether parent or not,
but even</p>
<p class="title">  “the parent of, or the person deriving any direct benefit from
the labour of, or having the control over, the child, young person or woman.” 
</p>
<p class="title">The Factory Acts Extension Act, which affects the large establishments,
derogates from the Factory Act by a crowd of vicious exceptions and cowardly
compromises with the masters.

<a name="a242" class="calibre14" id="a242"></a></p>
<p class="title">The Workshops’ Regulation Act, wretched in all its details,
remained a dead letter in the hands of the municipal and local authorities
who were charged with its execution. When, in 1871, Parliament withdrew
from them this power, in order to confer it on the Factory Inspectors,
to whose province it thus added by a single stroke more than one hundred
thousand workshops, and three hundred brickworks, care was taken at the
same time not to add more than eight assistants to their already undermanned
staff. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n242" class="calibre1">[242]</a></sup></p>
<p class="title">What strikes us, then, in the English legislation of 1867, is,
on the one hand, the necessity imposed on the parliament of the ruling
classes, of adopting in principle measures so extraordinary, and on so
great a scale, against the excesses of capitalistic exploitation; and on
the other hand, the hesitation, the repugnance, and the bad faith, with
which it lent itself to the task of carrying those measures into practice.
</p>
<p class="title">The Inquiry Commission of 1862 also proposed a new regulation
of the mining industry, an industry distinguished from others by the exceptional
characteristic that the interests of landlord and capitalist there join
hands. The antagonism of these two interests had been favourable to Factory
legislation, while on the other hand the absence of that antagonism is
sufficient to explain the delays and chicanery of the legislation on mines.
</p>
<p class="title">The Inquiry Commission of 1840 had made revelations so terrible,
so shocking, and creating such a scandal all over Europe, that to salve
its conscience Parliament passed the Mining Act of 1842, in which it limited
itself to forbidding the employment underground in mines of children under
10 years of age and females.
</p>
<p class="title">Then another Act, The Mines’ Inspecting Act of 1860, provides
that mines shall be inspected by public officers nominated specially for
that purpose, and that boys between the ages of 10 and 12 years shall not
be employed, unless they have a school certificate, or go to school for
a certain number of hours. This Act was a complete dead letter owing to
the ridiculously small number of inspectors, the meagreness of their powers,
and other causes that will become apparent as we proceed.
</p>
<p class="title">One of the most recent Blue books on mines is the “Report from
the Select Committee on Mines, together with &amp;c. Evidence, 23rd July,
1866.” This Report is the work of a Parliamentary Committee selected from
members of the House of Commons, and authorised to summon and examine witnesses.
It is a thick folio volume in which the Report <!--465-->itself occupies
only five lines to this effect; that the committee has nothing to say,
and that more witnesses must be examined!
</p>
<p class="title">The mode of examining the witnesses reminds one of the cross-examination
of witnesses in English courts of justice, where the advocate tries, by
means of impudent, unexpected, equivocal and involved questions, put without
connexion, to intimidate, surprise, and confound the witness, and to give
a forced meaning to the answers extorted from him. In this inquiry the
members of the committee themselves are the cross-examiners, and among
them are to be found both mine-owners and mine exploiters; the witnesses
are mostly working coal miners. The whole farce is too characteristic of
the spirit of capital, not to call for a few extracts from this Report.
For the sake of conciseness I have classified them. I may also add that
every question and its answer are numbered in the English Blue books.
</p>
<p class="title"><b class="calibre10">1. Employment in mines of boys of 10 years and upwards.</b>
— In the mines the work, inclusive of going and returning, usually lasts
14 or 15 hours, sometimes even from 3, 4 and 5 o’clock a.m., till 5 and
6 o’clock p.m. (n. 6, 452, 83). The adults work in two shifts, of eight
hours each; but there is no alternation with the boys, on account of the
expense (n. 80, 203, 204). The younger boys are chiefly employed in opening
and shutting the ventilating doors in the various parts of the mine; the
older ones are employed on heavier work. in carrying coal, &amp;c. (n.
122, 739, 1747). They work these long hours underground until their 18th
or 22nd year, when they are put to miner’s work proper (n. 161). Children
and young persons are at present worse treated, and harder worked than
at any previous period (n. 1663-1667). The miners demand almost unanimously
an act of Parliament prohibiting the employment in mines of children under
14. And now Hussey Vivian (himself an exploiter of mines) asks:</p>
<p class="title">  “Would not the opinion of the workman depend upon the poverty of the workman’s
family?” Mr. Bruce: “Do you not think it would be a very hard case, where
a parent had been injured, or where he was sickly, or where a father was
dead, and there was only a mother, to prevent a child between 12 and 14
earning 1s. 7d. a day for the good of the family? ... You must lay down
a general rule? ... Are you prepared to recommend legislation which would
prevent the employment of children under 12 and 14, whatever the state
of their parents might be?” “Yes.” (ns. 107-110). Vivian: “Supposing that
an enactment were passed preventing the employment of children under the
age of 14, would it not be probable that ... the parents of children would
seek employment for their children in other directions, for instance, in
manufacture?” “Not generally I think” (n. 174). Kinnaird: “Some of the
boys are keepers of doors?” “Yes.” “Is there not generally a very great
draught every time you open a door or close it?” “Yes, generally
there is.” “It sounds a very easy thing, but it is in fact rather a painful
one?” “He is imprisoned there just the same as if he was in a cell of a
gaol.” Bourgeois Vivian: “Whenever a boy is furnished with a lamp cannot
he read?” “Yes, he can read, if he finds himself in candles.... I suppose
he would be found fault with if he were discovered reading; he is there
to mind his business, he has a duty to perform, and he has to attend to
it in the first place, and I do not think it would be allowed down the
pit.” (ns. 139, 141, 143, 158, 160).
</p>
<p class="title"><b class="calibre10">II. Education.</b> — The working miners want a law for the
compulsory education of their children, as in factories. They declare the
clauses of the Act of 1860, which require a school certificate to be obtained
before employing boys of 10 and 12 years of age, to be quite illusory.
The examination of the witnesses on this subject is truly droll.</p>
<p class="title">  “Is it (the Act) required more against the masters or against the parents?” “It
is required against both I think.” “You cannot say whether it is required
against one more than against the other?” “No; I can hardly answer that
question.” (ns. 115, 116). “Does there appear to be any desire on the part
of the employers that the boys should have such hours as to enable them
to go to school?” “No; the hours are never shortened for that purpose.” 
 (n. 137) Mr. Kinnaird: “Should you say that the colliers generally improve
their education; have you any instances of men who have, since they began
to work, greatly improved their education, or do they not rather go back,
and lose any advantage that they may have gained?” “They generally become
worse: they do not improve; they acquire bad habits; they get on to drinking
and gambling and such like,, and they go completely to wreck.” (n. 21 1.)
 “Do they make any attempt of the kind (for providing instruction) by having
schools at night?” “There are few collieries where night schools are held,
and perhaps at those collieries a few boys do go to those schools; but
they are so physically exhausted that it is to no purpose that they go
there.” (n. 454.) “You are then,” concludes the bourgeois, “against education?” 
  “Most certainly not; but,” &amp;c. (n. 443.) “But are they (the employers)
not compelled to demand them (school certificates)?” “By law they are;
but I am not aware that they are demanded by the employers.” “Then it is
your opinion, that this provision of the Act as to requiring certificates,
is not generally carried out in the collieries?” “It is not carried out.” 
 (ns. 443, 444.) “Do the men take a great interest in this question (of
education)?” “The majority of them do.” (n. 717.) “Are they very anxious
to see the law enforced?” “The majority are.” (n. 718.) “Do you think that
in this country any law that you pass ... can really be effectual unless
the population themselves assist in putting it into operation?” “Many a
man might wish to object to employing a boy, but he would perhaps become
marked by it.” (n. 720.) “Marked by whom?” “By his employers.” 
 (n. 721.) “Do you think that the employers would find any fault with a
man who obeyed the law... ?” “I believe they would.” (n. 722.) “Have
you ever heard of any workman objecting to employ a boy between 10 and
12, who could not write or read?” “It is not left to men’s option.” (n.
123.) “Would you call for the interference of Parliament?” “I think that
if anything effectual is to be done in the education of the colliers’ children,
it will have to be made compulsory by Act of Parliament.” (n. 1634.) “Would
you lay that obligation upon the colliers only, or all the workpeople of
Great Britain?” “I came to speak for the colliers.” (n. 1636.) “Why should
you distinguish them (colliery boys) from other boys?” “Because I think
they are an exception to the rule.” (n. 1638.) “In what respect?” “In a
physical respect.” (n. 1639.) “Why should education be more valuable to
them than to other classes of lads?” “I do not know that it is more valuable;
but through the over-exertion in mines there is less chance for the boys
that are employed there to get education, either at Sunday schools, or
at day schools.” (n. 1640.) “It is impossible to look at a question of
this sort absolutely by itself?” (n. 1644.) “Is there a sufficiency of
schools?” — “No"... (n. 1646). “If the State were to require that every
child should be sent to school, would there be schools for the children
to go to?” “No; but I think if the circumstances were to spring up, the
schools would be forthcoming.” (n. 1647.) “Some of them (the boys) cannot
read and write at all, I suppose?” “The majority cannot... The majority
of the men themselves cannot.” (ns. 705, 725.)
</p>
<p class="title"><b class="calibre10">III. Employment of women.</b> — Since 1842 women are no more
employed underground, but are occupied on the surface in loading the coal,
&amp;c., in drawing the tubs to the canals and railway waggons, in sorting,
&amp;c. Their numbers have considerably increased during the last three
or four years. (n. 1727.) They are mostly the wives, daughters, and widows
of the working miners, and their ages range from 12 to 50 or 60 years.
(ns. 645, 1779.)</p>
<p class="title">  “What is the feeling among the working miners as to the
employment of women?” “I think they generally condemn it.” (n. 648.) “What
objection do you see to it?” “I think it is degrading to the sex.” (n.
649.) “There is a peculiarity of dress?” “Yes ... it is rather a man’s
dress, and I believe in some cases, it drowns all sense of decency.” “Do
the women smoke?” “Some do.” “And I suppose it is very dirty work?” “Very
dirty.” “They get black and grimy?” “As black as those who are down the
mines ... I believe that a woman having children (and there are plenty
on the banks that have) cannot do her duty to her children.” (ns. 650-654,
701.) “Do you think that those widows could get employment anywhere else,
which would bring them in as much wages as that (from 8s. to 10s. a week)?” 
  “I cannot speak to that.” (n. 709.) “You would still be prepared, would you,” 
 (flint-hearted fellow!) “to prevent their obtaining a livelihood by these
means?” “I would.” (n. 710.) “What is the general feeling in the district
... as to the employment of women?” “The feeling is that it is degrading;
and we wish as miners to have more respect to the fair sex than to see
them placed on the pit bank... Some part of the work is very hard; some
of these girls have raised as much as 10 tons of stuff a day.” (ns. 1715,1717.)
 “Do you think that the women employed about the collieries are less moral
than the women employed in the factories?” “. ..the percentage of bad ones
may be a little more ... than with the girls in the factories.” (n. 1237.)
 “But you are not quite satisfied with the state of morality in the factories?” 
  “No.” (n. 1733.) “Would you prohibit the employment of women in factories
also?” “No, I would not.” (n. 1734.) “Why not?” “I think it a more honourable
occupation for them in the mills.” (n. 1735.) “Still it is injurious to
their morality, you think?” “Not so much as working on the pit bank; but
it is more on the social position I take it; I do not take it on its moral
ground alone. The degradation, in its social bearing on the girls, is deplorable
in the extreme. When these 400 or 500 girls become colliers’ wives, the
men suffer greatly from this degradation, and it causes them to leave their
homes and drink.” (n. 1736.) “You would be obliged to stop the employment
of women in the ironworks as well, would you not, if you stopped it in
the collieries?” “I cannot speak for any other trade.” (n. 1737.) “Can
you see any difference in the circumstances of women employed in ironworks,
and the circumstances of women employed above ground in collieries?” “I
have not ascertained anything as to that.” (n. 1740.) “Can you see anything
that makes a distinction between one class and the other?” “I have not
ascertained that, but I know from house to house visitation, that it is
a deplorable state of things in our district....” (n. 1741.) “Would you
interfere in every case with the employment of women where that employment
was degrading?” “It would become injurious, I think, in this way: the best
feelings of Englishmen have been gained from the instruction of a mother.
... (n. 1750.) “That equally applies to agricultural employments, does
it not?” “Yes, but that is only for two seasons, and we have work all the
four seasons.” (n. 1751.) “They often work day and night, wet through to
the skin, their constitution undermined and their health ruined.” “You
have not inquired into that subject perhaps?” “I have certainly taken note
of it as I have gone along, and certainly I have seen nothing parallel
to the effects of the employment of women on the pit bank.... It is the
work of a man... a strong man.” (ns. 1753, 1793, 1794.) “Your feeling upon
the whole subject is that the better class of colliers who desire to raise
themselves and humanise themselves, instead of deriving help from the women,
are pulled down by them?” “Yes.” (n. 1808.) After some further
crooked questions from these bourgeois, the secret of their “sympathy” 
 for widows, poor families, &amp;c., comes out at last. “The coal proprietor
appoints certain gentlemen to take the oversight of the workings, and it
is their policy, in order to receive approbation, to place things on the
most economical basis they can, and these girls are employed at from 1s.
up to 1s. 6d. a day, where a man at the rate of 2s. 6d. a day would have
to be employed.” (n. 1816.)
</p>
<p class="title"><b class="calibre10">IV. Coroner’s inquests.</b> —</p>
<p class="title">  “With regard to coroner’s inquests
in your district, have the workmen confidence in the proceedings at those
inquests when accidents occur?” “No; they have not.” (n. 360.) “Why not?” 
  “Chiefly because the men who are generally chosen, are men who know nothing
about mines and such like.” “Are not workmen summoned at all upon the juries?” 
  “Never but as witnesses to my knowledge.” “Who are the people who are generally
summoned upon these juries?” “Generally tradesmen in the neighbourhood
... from their circumstances they are sometimes liable to be influenced
by their employers ... the owners of the works. They are generally men
who have no knowledge, and can scarcely understand the witnesses who are
called before them, and the terms which are used and such like.” “Would
you have the jury composed of persons who had been employed in mining?” 
  “Yes, partly... they (the workmen) think that the verdict is not in accordance
with the evidence given generally.” (ns. 361, 364, 366, 368, 371, 375.)
 “One great object in summoning a jury is to have an impartial one, is it
not?” “Yes, I should think so.” “Do you think that the juries would be
impartial if they were composed to a considerable extent of workmen?” “I
cannot see any motive which the workmen would have to act partially ...
they necessarily have a better knowledge of the operations in connexion
with the mine.” “You do not think there would be a tendency on the part
of the workmen to return unfairly severe verdicts?” “No, I think not.” 
 (ns. 378, 379, 380.)
</p>
<p class="title"><b class="calibre10">V. False weights and measures.</b> — The workmen demand to
be paid weekly instead of fortnightly, and by weight instead of by cubical
contents of the tubs; they also demand protection against the use of false
weights, &amp;c. (n. 1071.)</p>
<p class="title">  “If the tubs were fraudulently increased, a
man. could discontinue working by giving 14 days’ notice?” “But if he goes
to another place, there is the same thing going on there.” (n. 1071.) “But
he can leave that place where the wrong has been committed?” “It is general;
wherever he goes, he has to submit to it.” (n. 1072.) “Could a man leave
by giving 14 days’ notice?” “Yes.” (n. 1073.) And yet they are not satisfied!

<p class="title"><b class="calibre10">VI. Inspection of mines.</b> — Casualties from explosions
are not the only things the workmen suffer from. (n. 234, sqq.)</p>
<p class="title">  “Our men complained very much of the bad ventilation of the collieries ... the ventilation
is <!--470-->so bad in general that the men can scarcely breathe; they
are quite unfit for employment of any kind after they have been for a length
of time in connexion with their work; indeed, just at the part of the mine
where I am working, men have been obliged to leave their employment and
come home in consequence of that ... some of them have been out of work
for weeks just in consequence of the bad state of the ventilation where
there is not explosive gas ... there is plenty of air generally in the
main courses, yet pains are not taken to get air into the workings where
men are working.” “Why do you not apply to the inspector?” “To tell the
truth there are many men who are timid on that point; there have been cases
of men being sacrificed and losing their employment in consequence of applying
to the inspector.” “Why is he a marked man for having complained?” “Yes......
And he finds it difficult to get employment in another mine?” “Yes.” “Do
you think the mines in your neighbourhood are sufficiently inspected to
insure a compliance with the provisions of the Act?” “No; they are not
inspected at all ... the inspector has been down just once in the pit,
and it has been going seven years.... In the district to which I belong
there are not a sufficient number of inspectors. We have one old man more
than 70 years of age to inspect more than 130 collieries.” “You wish to
have a class of sub-inspectors?” “Yes.” (ns. 234, 241, 251, 254, 274, 275,
554, 276, 293.) “But do you think it would be possible for Government to
maintain such an army of inspectors as would be necessary to do all that
you want them to do, without information from the men?” “No, I should think
it would be next to impossible....” “It would be desirable the inspectors
should come oftener?” “Yes, and without being sent for.” (n. 280, 277.)
 “Do you not think that the effect of having these inspectors examining
the collieries so frequently would be to shift the responsibility (!) of
supplying proper ventilation from the owners of the collieries to the Government
officials?” “No, I do not think that, I think that they should make it
their business to enforce the Acts which are already in existence.” (n.
285.) “When you speak of sub-inspectors, do you mean men at a less salary,
and of an inferior stamp to the present inspectors?” “I would not have
them inferior, if you could get them otherwise.” (n. 294.) “Do you merely
want more inspectors, or do you want a lower class of men as an inspector?” 
  “A man who would knock about, and see that things are kept right; a man
who would not be afraid of himself.” (n. 295.) “If you obtained your wish
in getting an inferior class of inspectors appointed, do you think that
there would be no danger from want of skill, &amp;c?” “I think not, I think
that the Government would see after that, and have proper men in that position.” 
 (n. 297.)</p>
<p class="title">This kind of examination becomes at last too much even for the
chairman of the committee, and he interrupts with the observation:</p>
<p class="title">  “You want a class of men who would look into all the details of the mine,
and would go into all the holes and corners, and go into the real facts
... they would report to the chief inspector, who would then bring his
scientific knowledge to bear on the facts they have stated?” (ns. 298,
299.) “Would it not entail very great expense if all these old workings
were kept ventilated?” “Yes, expense might be incurred, but life would
be at the same time protected.” (n. 531.)</p>
<p class="title">A working miner objects to the
17th section of the Act of 1860; he says,</p>
<p class="title">  “At the present time, if the
inspector of mines finds a part of the mine unfit to work in, he has to
report it to the mine-owner and the Home Secretary. After doing that, there
is given to the owner 20 days to look over the matter; at the end of 20
days he has the power to refuse making any alteration in the mine; but,
when he refuses, the mine-owner writes to the Home Secretary, at the same
time nominating five engineers, and from those five engineers named by
the mine-owner himself, the Home Secretary appoints one, I think, as arbitrator,
or appoints arbitrators from them; now we think in that case the mine-owner
virtually appoints his own arbitrator.” (n. 581.)</p>
<p class="title">Bourgeois examiner, himself a mine-owner:</p>
<p class="title">  “But ... is this a merely speculative objection?” (n. 586.)
 “Then you have a very poor opinion of the integrity of mining engineers?” 
  “It is most certainly unjust and inequitable.” (n. 588.) “Do not mining
engineers possess a sort of public character, and do not you think that
they are above making such a partial decision as you apprehend?” “I do
not wish to answer such a question as that with respect to the personal
character of those men. I believe that in many cases they would act very
partially indeed, and that it ought not to be in their hands to do so,
where men’s lives are at stake.” (n. 589.)</p>
<p class="title">This same bourgeois is not ashamed
to put this question: “Do you not think that the mine-owner also suffers
loss from an explosion?” Finally, “Are not you workmen in Lancashire able
to take care of your own interests without calling in the Government to
help you?” “No.” (n. 1042.)
</p>
<p class="title">In the year 1865 there were 3,217 coal mines in Great Britain,
and 12 inspectors. A Yorkshire mine-owner himself calculates (<em class="calibre11">Times</em>,
26th January, 1867), that putting on one side their office work, which
absorbs all their time, each mine can be visited but once in ten years
by an inspector. No wonder that explosions have increased progressively,
both in number and extent (sometimes with a loss of 200-300 men), during
the last ten years. These are the beauties of “free” capitalist production!
<em class="calibre11">[This sentence has been added to the English text in conformity with
the 4th German edition. — Ed.</em>]
</p>
<p class="title">The very defective Act, passed in 1872, is the first that
regulates the hours of labour of the children employed in mines, and makes
exploiters and owners, to a certain extent, responsible for so-called accidents.
</p>
<p class="title">The Royal Commission appointed in 1867 to inquire into the employment
in agriculture of children, young persons, and women, has published some
very important reports. Several attempts to apply the principles of the
Factory Acts, but in a modified form, to agriculture have been made, but
have so far resulted in complete failure. All that I wish to draw attention
to here is the existence of an irresistible tendency towards the general
application of those principles.
</p>
<p class="title">If the general extension of factory legislation to all trades
for the purpose of protecting the working-class both in mind and body has
become inevitable, on the other hand, as we have already pointed out, that
extension hastens on the general conversion of numerous isolated small
industries into a few combined industries carried on upon a large scale;
it therefore accelerates the concentration of capital and the exclusive
predominance of the factory system. It destroys both the ancient and the
transitional forms, behind which the dominion of capital is still in part
concealed, and replaces them by the direct and open sway of capital; but
thereby it also generalises the direct opposition to this sway. While in
each individual workshop it enforces uniformity, regularity, order, and
economy, it increases by the immense spur which the limitation and regulation
of the working-day give to technical improvement, the anarchy and the catastrophes
of capitalist production as a whole, the intensity of labour, and the competition
of machinery with the labourer. <a name="a243" class="calibre14" id="a243"></a>By the destruction of petty and domestic
industries it destroys the last resort of the “redundant population,” and
with it the sole remaining safety-valve of the whole social mechanism.
By maturing the material conditions, and the combination on a social scale
of the processes of production, it matures the contradictions and antagonisms
of the capitalist form of production, and thereby provides, along with
the elements for the formation of a new society, the forces for exploding
the old one. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n243" class="calibre1">[243]</a></sup></p>

<hr class="end1"/><h3 id="calibre_toc_82" class="calibre17">SECTION 10 - MODERN INDUSTRY AND AGRICULTURE</h3>

<hr class="end1"/><p class="title">The revolution called forth by modern industry in
agriculture, and in the social relations of agricultural producers, will
be investigated later on. In this place, we shall merely indicate a few
results by way of anticipation. If the use of machinery in agriculture
is for the most part free from the injurious physical effect it has on
the factory operative, its action in superseding the labourers is more
intense, and finds less resistance, as we shall see later in detail. In
the counties of Cambridge and Suffolk, for example, the area of cultivated
land has extended very much within the last 20 years (up to 1868), while
in the same period the rural population has diminished, not only relatively,
but absolutely. In the United States it is as yet only virtually that agricultural
machines replace labourers; in other words, they allow of the cultivation
by the farmer of a larger surface, but do not actually expel the labourers
employed. In 1861 the number of persons occupied in England and Wales in
the manufacture of agricultural machines was 1,034, whilst the number of
agricultural labourers employed in the use of agricultural machines and
steam-engines did not exceed 1,205.
</p>
<p class="title"><!--474-->In the sphere of agriculture, modern industry has a more
revolutionary effect than elsewhere, for this reason, that it annihilates
the peasant, that bulwark of the old society, and replaces him by the wage-labourer.
Thus the desire for social changes, and the class antagonisms are brought
to the same level in the country as in the towns. The irrational, old-fashioned
methods of agriculture are replaced by scientific ones. Capitalist production
completely tears asunder the old bond of union which held together agriculture
and manufacture in their infancy. But at the same time it creates the material
conditions for a higher synthesis in the future, viz., the union of agriculture
and industry on the basis of the more perfected forms they have each acquired
during their temporary separation. <a name="a244" class="calibre14" id="a244"></a>Capitalist production, by collecting
the population in great centres, and causing an ever-increasing preponderance
of town population, on the one hand concentrates the historical motive
power of society; on the other hand, it disturbs the circulation of matter
between man and the soil, i.e., prevents the return to the soil of its
elements consumed by man in the form of food and clothing; it therefore
violates the conditions necessary to lasting fertility of the soil. By
this action it destroys at the same time the health of the town labourer
and the intellectual life of the rural labourer. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n244" class="calibre1">[244]</a></sup>
But while upsetting the naturally grown conditions for the maintenance
of that circulation of matter, it imperiously calls for its restoration
as a system, as a regulating law of social production, and under a form
appropriate to the full development of the human race. In agriculture as
in manufacture, the transformation of production under the sway of capital,
means, at the same time, the martyrdom of the producer; the instrument
of labour becomes the means of enslaving, exploiting, and impoverishing
the labourer; the social combination and organisation of labour-processes
is turned into an organised mode of crushing out the workman’s individual
vitality, freedom, and independence. The dispersion of the rural labourers
over larger areas breaks their power of resistance while concentration
increases that of the town operatives. <a name="a245" class="calibre14" id="a245"></a>In modern agriculture, as in the
urban industries, the increased productiveness and quantity of the labour
set in motion are bought at the cost of laying waste and consuming by disease
labour-power itself. Moreover, all progress in capitalistic agriculture
is a progress in the art, not only of robbing the <!--475 or p 508 in MECW v. 35-->labourer,
but of robbing the soil; all progress in increasing the fertility of the
soil for a given time, is a progress towards ruining the lasting sources
of that fertility. The more a country starts its development on the foundation
of modern industry, like the United States, for example, the more rapid
is this process of destruction. <sup class="enote"><a href="ch15_split_002.htm#n245" class="calibre1">[245]</a></sup> Capitalist production, therefore, develops technology, and the combining together of various processes
into a social whole, only by sapping the original sources of all wealth — the
soil and the labourer.

A critical history of technology would show how little any of the inventions of the 18th century are the work of a single individual. Hitherto there is no such book. Darwin has interested us in the history of Nature’s Technology, i.e., in the formation of the organs of plants and animals, which organs serve as instruments of production for sustaining life. Does not the history of the productive organs of man, of organs that are the material basis of all social organisation, deserve equal attention? And would not such a history be easier to compile, since, as Vico says, human history differs from natural history in this, that we have made the former, but not the latter? Technology discloses man’s mode of dealing with Nature, the process of production by which he sustains his life, and thereby also lays bare the mode of formation of his social relations, and of the mental conceptions that flow from them. Every history of religion, even, that fails to take account of this material basis, is uncritical. It is, in reality, much easier to discover by analysis the earthly core of the misty creations of religion, than, conversely, it is, to develop from the actual relations of life the corresponding celestialised forms of those relations. The latter method is the only materialistic, and therefore the only scientific one. The weak points in the abstract materialism of natural science, a materialism that excludes history and its process, are at once evident from the abstract and ideological conceptions of its spokesmen, whenever they venture beyond the bounds of their own speciality.  </p>

What it reduced to bondage in this case, was not the Dutchman, but the land for the Dutchman.

Morton read before the Society of Arts a paper on “The forces employed in agriculture.” He there states: “Every improvement that furthers the uniformity of the land makes the steam-engine more and more applicable to the production of pure mechanical force.... Horse-power is requisite wherever crooked fences and other obstructions prevent uniform action. These obstructions are vanishing day by day. For operations that demand more exercise of will than actual force, the only power applicable is that controlled every instant by the human mind-in other words, man-power.” Mr. Morton then reduces steam-power, horse-power, and man-power, to the unit in general use for steam-engines, namely, the force required to raise 33,000 lbs. one foot in one minute, and reckons the cost of one horse-power from a steam-engine to be 3d., and from a horse to be 5½d. per hour. Further, if a horse must fully maintain its health, it can work no more than 8 hours a day. Three at the least out of every seven horses used on tillage land during the year can be dispensed with by using steam-power, at an expense not greater than that which, the horses dispensed with, would cost during the 3 or 4 months in which alone they can be used effectively. Lastly, steam-power, in those agricultural operations in which it can be employed, improves, in comparison with horse-power, the quality of the work. To do the work of a steam-engine would require 66 men, at a total cost of 15S. an hour, and to do the work of a horse, 32 men, at a total cost of 8s. an hour.  </p>

The steam-engine is the parent of manufacturing towns.” (A. Redgrave in “Reports of the Insp. of Fact., 30th April, 1860,” p. 36.)  </p>
<p class="title"><span><a name="n15" href="ch15_split_000.htm#a15" class="calibre1" id="n15">15.</a></span> From the standpoint of division of labour in Manufacture, weaving was not simple, but, on the contrary, complicated manual labour; and consequently the power-loom is a machine that does very complicated work. It is altogether erroneous to suppose that modern machinery originally appropriated those operations alone, which division of labour had simplified. Spinning and weaving were, during the manufacturing period, split up into new species, and the implements were modified and improved; but the labour itself was in no way divided, and it retained its handicraft character. It is not the labour, but the instrument of labour, that serves as the starting-point of the machine.  </p>
<p class="title"><span><a name="n16" href="ch15_split_000.htm#a16" class="calibre1" id="n16">16.</a></span> Before the epoch of Mechanical Industry, the wool manufacture was the predominating manufacture in England. Hence it was in this industry that, in the first half of the 18th century, the most experiments were made. Cotton, which required less careful preparation for its treatment by machinery, derived the benefit of the experience gained on wool, just as afterwards the manipulation of wool by machinery was developed on the lines of cotton-spinning and weaving by machinery. It was only during the 10 years immediately preceding 1866, that isolated details of the wool manufacture, such as woolcombing, were incorporated in the factory system. “The application of power to the process of combing wool ... extensively in operation since the introduction of the combingmachine, especially Lister’s ... undoubtedly had the effect of throwing a very large number of men out of work. Wool was formerly combed by hand, most frequently in the cottage of the comber. It is now very generally combed in the factory, and hand-labour is superseded, except in some particular kinds of work, in which hand-combed wool is still preferred. Many of the hand-combers found employment in the factories, but the produce of the hand-combers bears so small a proportion to that of the machine, that the employment of a very large number of combers has passed away.” (“Rep. of lnsp. of Fact. for 31st Oct., 1856,” p. 16.)  </p>
<p class="title"><span><a name="n17" href="ch15_split_000.htm#a17" class="calibre1" id="n17">17.</a></span> “The principle of the factory system, then, is to substitute ... the partition of a process into its essential constituents, for the division or graduation of labour among artisans.” (Andrew Ure: “The Philosophy of Manufactures,” Lond., 1835, p. 20.)  </p>
<p class="title"><span><a name="n18" href="ch15_split_000.htm#a18" class="calibre1" id="n18">18.</a></span> The power-loom was at first made chiefly of wood; in its improved modern form it is made of iron. To what an extent the old forms of the instruments of production influenced their new forms at first starting, is shown by, amongst other things, the most superficial comparison of the present power-loom with the old one, of the modern blowing apparatus of a blast-furnace with the first inefficient mechanical reproduction of the ordinary bellows, and perhaps more strikingly than in any other way, by the attempts before the invention of the present locomotive, to construct a locomotive that actually had two feet, which after the fashion of a horse, it raised alternately from the ground. It is only after considerable development of the science of mechanics, and accumulated practical experience, that the form of a machine becomes settled entirely in accordance with mechanical principles, and emancipated from the traditional form of the tool that gave rise to it.  </p>

It is only during the last decade (i.e., since 1856) that another American, Mr. Emery, of Albany, New York, has rendered Whitney’s gin antiquated by an improvement as simple as it is effective.  </p>

This work also remarks: ‘Simple and outwardly unimportant as this appendage to lathes may appear, it is not, we believe, averring too much to state, that its influence in improving and extending the use of machinery has been as great as that produced by Watt’s improvements of the steam-engine itself.

The science of others is as much annexed by capital as the labour of others. Capitalistic appropriation and personal appropriation, whether of science or of material wealth, are, however, totally different things. Dr. Ure himself deplores the gross ignorance of mechanical science existing among his dear machinery-exploiting manufacturers, and Liebig can a tale unfold about the astounding ignorance of chemistry displayed by English chemical manufacturers.  </p>
<p class="title"><span><a name="n24" href="ch15_split_000.htm#a24" class="calibre1" id="n24">24.</a></span> Ricardo lays such stress on this effect of machinery (of which, in other connexions, he takes no more notice than he does of the general distinction between the labour process and the process of creating surplus-value), that he occasionally loses sight of the value given up by machines to the product, and puts machines on the same footing as natural forces. Thus “Adam Smith nowhere undervalues the services which the natural agents and machinery perform for us, but he very justly distinguishes the nature of the value which they add to commodities... as they perform their work gratuitously, the assistance which they afford us, adds nothing to value in exchange.” (Ric., l.c., pp. 336, 337.) This observation of Ricardo is of course correct in so far as it is directed against J. B. Say, who imagines that machines render the “service” of creating value which forms a part of “profits.”  </p>
<p class="title"><span><a name="n25" href="ch15_split_000.htm#a25" class="calibre1" id="n25">25.</a></span> A horse-power is equal to a force of 33,000 foot-pounds per minute, i.e., to a force that raises 33,000 pounds one foot in a minute, or one pound 33,000 feet. This is the horse power meant in the text. In ordinary language, and also here and there in quotations in this work, a distinction is drawn between the “nominal” and the “commercial” or “indicated” horse-power of the same engine. The old or nominal horse-power is calculated exclusively from the length of piston-stroke, and the diameter of the cylinder, and leaves pressure of steam and piston speed out of consideration. It expresses practically this: This engine would be one of 50 horse-power, if it were driven with the same low pressure of steam, and the same slow piston speed, as in the days of Boulton and Watt. But the two latter factors have increased enormously since those days. In order to measure the mechanical force exerted today by an engine, an indicator has been invented which shows the pressure of the steam in the cylinder. The piston speed is easily ascertained. Thus the “indicated” or “commercial” horse-power of an engine is expressed by a mathematical formula, involving diameter of cylinder, length of stroke, piston speed, and steam pressure, simultaneously, and showing what multiple of 33,000 pounds is really raised by the engine in a minute. Hence, one “nominal” horse-power may exert three, four, or even five “indicated” or “real” horse-powers. This observation is made for the purpose of explaining various citations in the subsequent pages. — <em class="calibre11">F. E</em>.  </p>

It is, however, easily seen that since a machine no more creates new value than any other part of constant capital, it cannot add any value under the name of “interest.” It is also evident that here, where we are treating of the production of surplus-value, we cannot assume <em class="calibre11">a priori</em> the existence of any part of that value under the name of interest. The capitalist mode of calculating, which appears, <em class="calibre11">primâ facie</em>, absurd, and repugnant to the laws of the creation of value, will be explained in the third book of this work.  </p>

It may here be incidentally observed, that Descartes, in defining animals as mere machines, .saw with eyes of the manufacturing period, while to eyes of the middle ages, animals were assistants to man, as they were later to Von Haller in his “Restauration der Staatswissenschaften.” That Descartes, like Bacon, anticipated an alteration in the form of production, and the practical subjugation of Nature by Man, as a result of the altered methods of thought, is plain from his “Discours de la Méthode.” He there says: “Il est possible (by the methods he introduced in philosophy) de parvenir à des connaissances fort utiles à la vie, et qu’au lieu de cette philosophie spéculative qu’on enseigne dans les écoles, on en peut trouver une pratique, par laquelle, connaissant la force et les actions du feu, de l’eau, de l’air, des astres, et de tous les autres corps qui nous environnent, aussi distinctement que nous connaissons les divers métiers de nos artisans, nous les pourrions employer en même façon à tous les usages auxquels ils sont propres, et ainsi nous rendre comme maîtres et possesseurs de la nature” and thus “contribuer au perfectionnement de la vie humaine.” <span>[It is possible to attain knowledge very useful in life and, in place of the speculative philosophy taught in the schools, one can find a practical philosophy by which, given that we know the powers and the effectiveness of fire, water, air, the stars, and all the other bodies that surround us, as well and as accurately as we know the various trades of our craftsmen, we shall be able to employ them in the same manner as the latter to all uses to which they are adapted, and thus as it were make ourselves the masters and possessors of nature, and thus contributing to the perfection of human life.]</span> In the preface to Sir Dudley North’s “Discourses upon Trade” (1691) it is stated, that Descartes’ method had begun to free Political Economy from the old fables and superstitious notions of gold, trade, &amp;c. On the whole, however, the early English economists sided with Bacon and Hobbes as their philosophers; while, at a later period, the philosopher [...] of Political Economy in England, France, and Italy, was Locke.  </p>

He reported, that from a hygienic point of view, and apart from the banishment of the operatives from the factory atmosphere, the crisis had several advantages. The women now had sufficient leisure to give their infants the breast, instead of poisoning them with “Godfrey’s cordial.” They had time to learn to cook. Unfortunately the acquisition of this art occurred at a time when they had nothing to cook. But from this we see how capital, for the purposes of its self-expansion, has usurped the labour necessary in the home of the family. This crisis was also utilised to teach sewing to the daughters of the workmen in sewing schools. An American revolution and a universal crisis, in order that the working girls, who spin for the whole world, might learn to sew!  </p>
<p class="title"><span><a name="n39" href="ch15_split_000.htm#a39" class="calibre1" id="n39">39.</a></span> “The numerical increase of labourers has been great, through the growing substitution of female for male, and above all, of childish for adult labour. Three girls of 13, at wages of from 6 shillings to 8 shillings a week, have replaced the one man of mature age, of wages varying from 18 shillings to 45 shillings.” (Th. de Quincey: “The Logic of Political Econ.,” London, 1844. Note to p. 147.) Since certain family functions, such as nursing and suckling children, cannot be entirely suppressed, the mothers confiscated by capital, must try substitutes of some sort. Domestic work, such as sewing and mending, must be replaced by the purchase of ready-made articles. Hence, the diminished expenditure of labour in the house is accompanied by an increased expenditure of money. The cost of keeping the family increases, and balances the greater income. In addition to this, economy and judgment in the consumption and preparation of the means of subsistence becomes impossible. Abundant material relating to these facts, which are concealed by official Political Economy, is to be found in the Reports of the Inspectors of Factories, of the Children’s Employment Commission, and more especially in the Reports on Public Health.  </p>
<p class="title"><span><a name="n40" href="ch15_split_000.htm#a40" class="calibre1" id="n40">40.</a></span> In striking contrast with the great fact, that the shortening of the hours of labour of women and children in English factories was exacted from capital by the male operatives, we find in the latest reports of the Children’s Employment Commission traits of the operative parents in relation to the traffic in children, that are truly revolting and thoroughly like slave-dealing. But the Pharisee of a capitalist, as may be seen from the same reports, denounces this brutality which he himself creates, perpetuates, and exploits, and which he moreover baptises “freedom of labour.” “Infant labour has been called into aid ... even to work for their own daily bread. Without strength to endure such disproportionate toil, without instruction to guide their future life, they have been thrown into a situation physically and morally polluted. The Jewish historian has remarked upon the overthrow of Jerusalem by Titus that it was no wonder it should have been destroyed, with such a signal destruction, when an inhuman mother sacrificed her own offspring to satisfy the cravings of absolute hunger.” (“Public Economy Concentrated.” Carlisle, 1833, p. 66.)  </p>

In those industries where the Factory Act proper (not the Print Works Act referred to in the text) has been in force for some time, the obstacles in the way of the education clauses have, in recent years, been overcome. In industries not under the Act, the views of Mr. J. Geddes, a glass manufacturer, still extensively prevail. He informed Mr. White, one of the Inquiry Commissioners: “As far as I can see, the greater amount of education which a part of the working-class has enjoyed for some years past is an evil. It is dangerous, because it makes them independent.” (“Children’s Empl. Comm., Fourth Report,” Lond., 1865, p. 253.)  </p>

Thus are the virtues, the peculiar virtues of the female character to be perverted to her injury – thus all that is most dutiful and tender in her nature is made a means of her bondage and suffering.” (Ten Hours’ Factory Bill.

Thus, for instance, Ficiden, himself a manufacturer, says: “It is evident that the long hours of work were brought about by the circumstance of so great a number of destitute children being supplied from different parts of the country, that the masters were independent of the hands, and that having once established the custom by means of the miserable materials they had procured in this way, they could impose it on their neighbours with the greater facility.” (J. Ficiden: “The Curse of the Factory System,” Lond., 1836, p. I 1.) With reference to the labour of women, Saunders, the factory inspector, says in his report of 1844: “Amongst the female operatives there are some women who, for many weeks in succession, except for a few days, are employed from 6 a. in. till midnight, with less than 2 hours for meals, so that on 5 days of the week they have only 6 hours left out of the 24, for going to and from their homes and resting in bed.”  </p>

In these stormy, go-ahead times, therefore, the tulle manufacturers soon extended the working-day, by means of double sets of hands, from the original 8 hours to 24.  </p>

Let Chanticleer announce the morn in vain! Deo has commanded the work of the girls to be done by the Nymphs, and now they skip lightly over the wheels, so that the shaken axles revolve with their spokes and pull round the load of the revolving stones.

Lond., 1961 and 1866. In Lancashire the number of mills increased only 4 per cent. between 1839 and 1850; 19 per cent. between 1850 and 1856; and 33 per cent. between 1856 and 1862; while the persons employed in them during each of the above periods of It years increased absolutely, but diminished relatively. (See “Rep. of Insp. of Fact., for 31st Oct., 1862,” p. 63.) The cotton trade preponderates in Lancashire. We may form an idea of the stupendous nature of the cotton trade in that district when we consider that, of the gross number of textile factories in the United Kingdom, it absorbs 45.2 per cent., of the spindles 83.3 per cent., of the power-looms 81.4 per cent., of the mechanical horse-power 72.6 per cent., and of the total number of persons employed 58.2 per cent.

He says, “in case of need,” the workmen can be moved at the will of the manager from one machine to another, and he triumphantly exclaims: “Such a change is in flat contradiction with the old routine, that divides the labour, and to one workman assigns the task of fashioning the head of a needle, to another the sharpening of the point.” He had much better have asked himself, why this “old routine” is departed from in the automatic factory, only “in case of need. “  </p>

The English “ateliers nationaux” <span>[national workshops]</span> of 1862 and the following years, established for the benefit of the destitute cotton operatives, differ from the French of 1848 in this, that in the latter the workmen had to do unproductive work at the expense of the state, in the former they had to do productive municipal work to the advantage of the bourgeois, and that, too, cheaper than the regular workmen, with whom they were thus thrown into competition. “The physical appearance of the cotton operatives is unquestionably improved. This I attribute ... as to the men, to outdoor labour on public works.” (“Rep. of Insp. of Fact., 31st Oct., 1863,” p. 59.) The writer here alludes to the Preston factory operatives, who were employed on Preston Moor.  </p>

So soon as it shall happen that the children of the manufacturers themselves have to go through a course of schooling as helpers in the mill, this almost unexplored territory of mechanics will soon make remarkable progress. “Of machinery, perhaps self-acting mules are as dangerous as any other kind. Most of the accidents from them happen to little children, from their creeping under the mules to sweep the floor whilst the mules are in motion. Several ‘minders’ have been fined for this offence, but without much general benefit. If machine makers would only invent a self-sweeper, by whose use the necessity for these little children to creep under the machinery might be prevented, it would be a happy addition to our protective measures.” (“Reports of Insp. of Fact. for 31st.

Ce travail de surveillance qui servirait peut-être d’utile gymnastique à l’intelligence, s’il n’était pas trop prolongé, détruit à la longue, par son excès, et l’intelligence, et le corps même.” <span>[A man becomes exhausted more quickly when he watches over the uniform motion of mechanism for fifteen hours a day, than when he applies his physical strength over the same period of time. This labour of surveillance, which might perhaps serve as a useful exercise for the mind, if it did not go on too long, destroys both the mind and the body in the long run, through excessive application]</span> (G. de Molinari: “Études Économiques.” Paris, 1846.)  </p>

In it all freedom comes to an end both at law and in fact. The workman must be in the factory at half past five. If he come a few minutes late, he is punished; if he come 10 minutes late, he is not allowed to enter until after breakfast, and thus loses a quarter of a day’s wage. He must eat, drink and sleep at word of command.... The despotic bell calls him from his bed, calls him from breakfast and dinner. And how does he fare in the mill? There the master is the absolute law-giver. He makes what regulations he pleases; he alters and makes additions to his code at pleasure; and if he insert the veriest nonsense, the courts say to the workman: Since you have entered into this contract voluntarily, you must now carry it out .... These workmen are condemned to live, from their ninth year till their death, under this mental and bodily torture.” (F. Engels, l.c., p. 217, sq.) What, “the courts say,” I will illustrate by two examples. One occurs at Sheffield at the end of 1866. In that town a workman had engaged himself for 2 years in a steelworks. In consequence of a quarrel with his employer he left the works, and declared that under no circumstances would he work for that master any more. He was prosecuted for breach of contract, and condemned to two months’ imprisonment. (If the master break the contract, he can be proceeded against only in a civil action, and risks nothing but money damages.) After the workman has served his two months, the master invites him to return to the works, pursuant to the contract. Workman says: No, he has already been punished for the breach. The master prosecutes again, the court condemns again, although one of the judges, Mr. Shee, publicly denounces this as a legal monstrosity, by which a man can periodically, as long as he lives, be punished over and over again for the same offence or crime. This judgment was given not by the “Great Unpaid,” the provincial Dogberries, but by one of the highest courts of justice in London. — [Added <em class="calibre11">in the 4th German edition. — This</em> has now been done away with. With few exceptions, e.g., when public gas-works are involved, the worker in England is now put on an equal footing with the employer in case of breach of contract and can be sued only civilly. — F. E.] The second case occurs in Wiltshire at the end of November 1863. About 30 power-loom weavers, in the employment of one Harrup, a cloth manufacturer at Leower’s Mill, Westbury Leigh, struck work because master Harrup indulged in the agreeable habit of making deductions from their wages for being late in the morning; 6d. for 2 minutes; 1s. for 3 minutes, and 1s. 6d. for ten minutes. This is at the rate of 9s. per hour, and £4 10s. 0d. per diem; while the wages of the weavers on the average of a year, never exceeded 10s. to 12s. weekly. Harrup also appointed a boy to announce the starting time by a whistle, which he often did before six o’clock in the morning: and if the hands were not all there at the moment the whistle ceased, the doors were closed, and those hands who were outside were fined: and as there was no clock on the premises, the unfortunate hands were at the mercy of the young Harrup-inspired time-keeper. The hands on strike, mothers of families as well as girls, offered to resume work if the timekeeper were replaced by a clock, and a more reasonable scale of fines were introduced. Harrup summoned I9 women and girls before the magistrates for breach of contract. To the utter indignation of all present, they were each mulcted in a fine of 6d. and 2s. 6d. for costs. Harrup was followed from the court by a crowd of people who hissed him. A favourite operation with manufacturers is to punish the workpeople by deductions made from their wages on account of faults in the material worked on. This method gave rise in 1866 to a general strike in the English pottery districts. The reports of the Ch. Empl. Corn. (1863-1866), give cases where the worker not only receives no wages, but becomes, by means of his labour, and of the penal regulations, the debtor to boot, of his worthy master. The late cotton crisis also furnished edifying examples of the sagacity shown by the factory autocrats in making deductions from wages. Mr. R. Baker, the Inspector of Factories, says, “I have myself had lately to direct prosecutions against one cotton mill occupier for having in these pinching and painful times deducted 10d. a piece from some of the young workers employed by him, for the surgeon’s certificate (for which he himself had only paid 6d.), when only allowed by the law to deduct 3d., and by custom nothing at all .... And I have been informed of another, who, in order to keep without the law, but to attain the same object, charges the poor children who work for him a shilling each, as a fee for learning them the art and mystery of cotton spinning, so soon as they are declared by the surgeon fit and proper persons for that occupation. There may therefore be undercurrent causes for such extraordinary exhibitions as strikes, not only wherever they arise, but particularly at such times as the present, which without explanation, render them inexplicable to the public understanding.” He alludes here to a strike of power-loom weavers at Darwen, June, 1863. (“Reports of Insp. of Fact. for 30 April, 1863,” pp. 50-51.) The reports always go beyond their official dates.  </p>
<p class="title"><span><a name="n109" href="ch15_split_000.htm#a109" class="calibre1" id="n109">109.</a></span> The protection afforded by the Factory Acts against dangerous machinery has had a beneficial effect. “But ... there are other sources of accident which did not exist twenty years since; one especially, viz., the increased speed of the machinery. Wheels, rollers, spindles and shuttles are now propelled at increased and increasing rates; fingers must be quicker and defter in their movements to take up the broken thread, for, if placed with hesitation or carelessness, they are sacrificed.... A large number of accidents are caused by the eagerness of the workpeople to get through their work expeditiously. It must be remembered that it is of the highest importance to manufacturers that their machinery should be in motion, i.e., producing yams and goods. Every minute’s stoppage is not only a loss of power, but of production, and the workpeople are urged by the overlookers, who are interested in the quantity of work turned off, to keep the machinery in motion, and it is no less important to those of the operatives who are paid by the weight or piece, that the machines should be kept in motion. Consequently, although it is strictly forbidden in many, nay in most factories, that machinery should be cleaned while in motion, it is nevertheless the constant practice in most, if not in all, that the workpeople do, unreproved, pick out waste, wipe rollers and wheels, &amp;c., while their frames are in motion. Thus from this cause only, 906 accidents have occurred during the six months.... Although a great deal of cleaning is constantly going on day by day, yet Saturday is generally the day set apart for the thorough cleaning of the machinery, and a great deal of this is done while the machinery is in motion.” Since cleaning is not paid for, the workpeople seek to get done with it as speedily as possible. Hence “the number of accidents which occur on Fridays, and especially on Saturdays, is much larger than on any other day. On the former day the excess is nearly 12 per cent. over the average number of the four first days of the week, and on the latter day the excess is 25 per cent. over the average of the preceding five days; or, if the number of working-hours on Saturday being taken into account — 7½ hours on Saturday as compared with 10½ on other days — there is an excess of 65 per cent. on Saturdays over the average of the other five days.” (“Rep. of Insp. of Fact., 31st Oct., 1866,” pp. 9, 15, 16, 17.)  </p>

I shall give an account of a recent campaign by the English manufacturers against the Clauses in the Factory Acts that protect the “hands” against dangerous machinery. For the present, let this one quotation from the official report of Leonard Horner suffice: “I have heard some mill-owners speak with inexcusable levity of some of the accidents; such, for instance, as the loss of a finger being a trifling matter. A working-man’s living and prospects depend so much upon his fingers, that any loss of them is a very serious matter to him. When I have heard such inconsiderate remarks made, I have usually put this question: Suppose you were in want of an additional workman, and two were to apply, both equally well qualified in other respects, but one had lost a thumb or a forefinger, which would you engage? There never was a hesitation as to the answer....” The manufacturers have “mistaken prejudices against what they have heard represented as a pseudo-philanthropic legislation.” (“Rep. of Insp. of Fact., 31st Oct., 1855.") These manufacturers are clever folk, and not without reason were they enthusiastic for the slave-holders’ rebellion.  </p>
<p class="title"><span><a name="n111" href="ch15_split_000.htm#a111" class="calibre1" id="n111">111.</a></span> In those factories that have been longest subject to the Factory Acts, with their compulsory limitation of the hours of labour, and other regulations, many of the older abuses have vanished. The very improvement of the machinery demands to a certain extent “improved construction of the buildings,” and this is an advantage to the workpeople. (See “Rep. of Insp. of Fact. for 31st Oct., 1863,” p. 109.)  </p>

The invariable object of the former is to get their work done as cheaply as possible; and they do not fail to employ every artifice to this purpose, whilst the latter are equally attentive to every occasion of distressing their masters into a compliance with higher demands.” (“An Enquiry into the Causes of the Present High Price of Provisions,” pp. 61-62.

En quoi l’effet d’une machine diffère-t-il de celui de nouveaux habitants?” (French trans. t. I., l. I., ch. XIX.) More naïve is Petty, who says, it replaces “Polygamy.” The above point of view is, at the most, admissible only for some parts of the United States. On the other hand, “machinery can seldom be used with success to abridge the labour of an individual; more time would be lost in its construction than could be saved by its application. It is only really useful when it acts on great masses, when a single machine can assist the work of thousands. It is accordingly in the most populous countries, where there are most idle men, that it is most abundant.... It is trot called into use by a scarcity of men, but by the facility with which they can be brought to work in masses.” (Piercy Ravenstone: “Thoughts on the Funding System and its Effects.” London, 1824, p. 45.)  </p>

Mr. Turner was, in 1827, rector of Wilmslow in Cheshire, a manufacturing district. The questions of the Committee of Emigration, and Mr. Turner’s answers, show how the competition of human labour is maintained against machinery. ‘Question: Has not the use of the power-loom superseded the use of the hand-loom? Answer: Undoubtedly; it would have superseded them much more than it has done, if the hand-loom weavers were not enabled to submit to a reduction of wages.’ ‘Question: But in submitting he has accepted wages which are insufficient to support him, and looks to parochial contribution as the remainder of his support? Answer: Yes, and in fact the competition between the hand-loom and the power-loom is maintained out of the poor-rates.’ Thus degrading pauperism or expatriation, is the benefit which the industrious receive from the introduction of machinery, to be reduced from the respectable and in some degree independent mechanic, to the cringing wretch who lives on the debasing bread of charity. This they call a temporary inconvenience.” (“A Prize Essay on the Comparative Merits of Competition and Co-operation.” Lond., 1834, p. 29.)  </p>

The rapid improvement of machinery, during the crisis, allowed the English manufacturers, immediately after the termination of the American Civil War, and almost in no time, to glut the markets of the world again. Cloth,’ during the last six months of 1866, was almost unsaleable. Thereupon began the consignment of goods to India and China, thus naturally making the glut more intense. At the beginning of 1867 the manufacturers resorted to their usual way out of the difficulty, viz., reducing wages 5 per cent. The workpeople resisted, and said that the only remedy was to work short time, 4 days a-week; and their theory was the correct one. After holding out for some time, the self-elected captains of industry had to make up their minds to short time, with reduced wages in some places, and in others without.  </p>

Say, remarks on this point: “Where division of labour is well developed, the skill of the labourer is available only in that particular branch in which it has been acquired; he himself is a sort of machine. It does not therefore help matters one jot, to repeat in parrot fashion, that things have a tendency to find their level. On looking around us we cannot but see, that they are unable to find their level for a long time; and that when they do find it, the level is always lower than at the commencement of the process.” (“An Inquiry into those Principles Respecting the Nature of Demand,” &amp;c., Lond. 1821, p. 72.)  </p>

It is not possible to bring out the cretinism of his standpoint, except by his own words: “Les classes condamnées à produire et à consommer diminuent, et les classes qui dirigent le travail, qui soulagent, consolent, et éclairent toute la population, se multiplient ... et s’approprient tous les bienfaits qui résultent de la diminution des frais du travail, de l’abondance des productions, et du bon marché des consommations. Dans cette direction, l’espéce humaine s’élève aux plus hautes conceptions du génie, pénètre dans les profoundeurs mystérieuses de la religion, établit les principes salutaires de la morale (which consists in ‘s’approprier tous les beinfaits,’ &amp;c.), les lois tutélaires de la liberté (liberty of ‘les classes condamnées à produire?’) et du pouvoir, de l’obéissance et de la justice, du devoir et de la l’humanité.” <span>[The classes condemned to produce and to consume diminish, and the classes which direct labour, which relieve, console and enlighten the whole population, multiply ... and appropriate all the benefits which result from the diminution of the costs of labour, from the abundance of products and the cheapness of consumer goods. In this way, the human species rises to the highest creations of genius, penetrates the mysterious depths of religion, and establishes the salutory principles of morality, the laws for the protection of liberty, and power, of obedience and justice, of obligation and humanity]</span> For this twaddle, see “Des Systèmes d’Economie Politique, &amp;c., Par M.

At that time good wages could be earned. Great competition was shown between the different firms as to which could turn out the neatest article. Shortly afterwards, however a worse kind of competition sprang up, namely, that of underselling one another in the market. The injurious consequences soon manifested themselves in reductions of wages, and so sweepingly quick was the fall in the price of labour, that many firms now pay only one half of the original wages. And yet, though wages sink lower and lower, profits appear, with each alteration in the scale of wages, to increase.” Even bad times are utilised by the manufacturers, for making exceptional profits by excessive lowering of wages, i.e., by a direct robbery of the labourer’s means of subsistence. One example (it has reference to the crisis in the Coventry silk weaving): “From information I have received from manufacturers as well as workmen, there seems to be no doubt that wages have been reduced to a greater extent than either the competition of the foreign producers, or other circumstances have rendered necessary ... the majority of weavers are working at a reduction of 30 to 40 per cent. in their wages. A piece of ribbon for. making which the weaver got 6s. or 7s. five years back, now only brings them 3s. 3d. or 3s. 6d.; other work is now priced at 2s. and 2s. 3d. which was formerly priced at 4s. and 4s. 3d. The reduction in wage seems to have been carried to a greater extent than is necessary for increasing demand. Indeed, the reduction in the cost of weaving, in the case of many descriptions of ribbons, has net been accompanied by any corresponding reduction in the selling price of the manufactured article.” (Mr. F. D. Longes Report. “Ch. Emp. Corn., V. Rep., 1866,” p. 114, 1.)  </p>

In 1858 the official value of cotton goods exported, was £182,221,681; but the real or marketable value was only £43,001,322, being a ten-fold quantity sold for little more than double the former price. To produce results so disadvantageous to the country generally, and to the factory workers in particular, several causes have cooperated, which, had circumstances permitted, we should have brought more prominently under your notice; suffice it for the present to say that the most obvious one is the constant redundancy of labour, without which a trade so ruinous in its effects never could have been carried on, and which requires a constantly extending market to save it from annihilation. Our cotton mills may be brought to a stand by the periodical stagnations of trade, which, under present arrangements, are as inevitable as death itself; but the human mind is constantly at work, and although we believe we are under the mark in stating that six millions of persons have left these shores during the last 25 years, yet, from the natural increase of population, and the displacement of labour to cheapen production, a large percentage of the male adults in the most prosperous times find it impossible to obtain work in factories on any conditions whatever.” (“Reports of Insp. of Fact., 30th April 1863,” pp. 51-52.) We shall, in a later chapter, see how our friends, the manufacturers, endeavoured, during the catastrophe in the cotton trade, to prevent by every means, including State interference, the emigration of the operatives.  </p>

Birmingham has the monopoly of this industry in the United Kingdom, and at present produces thousands of millions of steel-pens. According to the Census of 1861, the number of persons employed was 1,428, of whom 1,268 females from 5 years of age upwards.  </p>

Dr. Simon remarks that the mortality among the London tailors and printers between the ages of 25 and 35 is in fact much greater, because the employers in London obtain from the country a great number of young people up to 30 years of age, as “apprentices” and “improvers,” who come for the purpose of being perfected in their trade. These figure in the census as Londoners, they swell out the number of heads on which the London death-rate is calculated, without adding proportionally to the number of deaths in that place. The greater part of them in fact return to the country, and especially in cases of severe illness. (l.c.)  </p>

It has two great mischiefs in it. 1st, The journeymen are miserable in winter for want of work, the mercers and master-weavers not daring to lay out their stocks to keep the journeymen employed before the spring comes, and they know what the fashion will then be; 2ndly, In the spring the journeymen are not sufficient, but the master-weavers must draw in many prentices, that they may supply the trade of the kingdom in a quarter or half a year, which robs the plough of hands, drains the country of labourers, and in a great part stocks the city with beggars, and starves some in winter that are ashamed to beg.” (“Essays about the Poor, Manufactures, &amp;c.,” p. 9.)  </p>

It is merely a question of extra hands and extra outlay. If some masters were not so greedy, the boys would not work late; an extra machine costs only £16 or £18; much of such over-time as does occur is to be referred to an insufficiency of appliances, and a want of space.” “Ch.

A London manufacturer, who in other respects looks upon the compulsory regulation of the hours of labour as a protection for the workpeople against the manufacturers, and for the manufacturers themselves against the wholesale trade, states: “The pressure in our business is caused by the shippers, who want, e.g., to send the goods by sailing vessel so as to reach their destination at a given season, and at the same time want to pocket the difference in freight between a sailing vessel and a steamship, or who select the earlier of two steamships in order to be in the foreign market before their competitors.”  </p>

Hence the air inhaled in 24 hours by each individual is about 720,000 cubic inches, or 416 cubic feet. It is clear, however, that air which has been once breathed, can no longer serve for the same process until it has been purified in the great workshop of Nature. According to the experiments of Valentin and Brunner, it appears that a healthy man gives off about 1,300 cubic inches of carbonic acid per hour; this would give about 8 ounces of solid carbon thrown off from the lungs in 24 hours.” Every man should have at least 800 cubic feet.” (Huxley.)  </p>

A silk manufacturer naively states to the Children’s Employment Commissioners: “I am quite sure that the true secret of producing efficient workpeople is to be found in uniting education and labour from a period of childhood. Of course the occupation must not be too severe, nor irksome, or unhealthy. But of the advantage of the union I have no doubt. I wish my own children could have some work as well as play to give variety to their schooling.” (“Ch. Empl. Comm. V. Rep.,” p. 82, n. 36.)  </p>

How modern industry, when it has attained to a certain pitch, is capable, by the revolution it effects in the mode of production and in the social conditions of production, of also revolutionising people’s minds, is strikingly shown by a comparison of Senior’s speech in 1863, with his philippic against the Factory Act of 1833; or by a comparison, of the views of the congress above referred to, with the fact that in certain country districts of England poor parents are forbidden, on pain of death by starvation, to educate their children. Thus, e.g., Mr. Snell reports it to be a common occurrence in Somersetshire that, when a poor person claims parish relief, he is compelled to take his children from school. Mr. Wollarton, the clergyman at Feltham, also tells of cases where all relief was denied to certain families “because they were sending their children to school!”  </p>

At first the steam-engine replaces this labourer, afterwards he must replace the steam-engine. Consequently the tension and the amount of labour-power expended become monstrous, and especially so in the case of the children who are condemned to this torture. Thus Mr. Longe; one of the commissioners, found in Coventry and the neighbourhood boys of from 10 to 15 years employed in driving the ribbon-looms, not to mention younger children who had to drive smaller machines. “It is extraordinarily fatiguing work. The boy is a mere substitute for steam power.” (“Ch. Empl. Comm. V, Rep. 1866;” p. 114, n. 6.)

Many a shepherd and cottar too, with his wife and children, appeared at Church in clothes which had been touched by no hands but their own, since they were shorn from the sheep and sown in the flaxfield. In the preparation of these. it is added, scarcely a single article had been purchased, except the awl, needle, thimble, and a very few parts of the iron-work employed in the weaving.

Conservation, in an unaltered form, of the old modes of production was on the contrary the first condition of existence for all earlier industrial classes. Constant revolution in production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions, everlasting uncertainty and agitation, distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones. All fixed, fast-frozen relations, with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, are swept away, all new formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify. All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real conditions of life, and his relations with his kind.” (F.

As mining did not turn out remunerative enough, I left it for the town, where in succession I became typographer, slater, plumber, &amp;c.

Amongst other things he says this: “An idle learning being little better than the learning of idleness.... Bodily labour, it’s a primitive institution of God.... Labour being as proper for the bodies’ health as eating is for its living; for what pains a man saves by ease, he will find in disease.... Labour adds oil to the lamp of life, when thinking inflames it.... A childish silly employ” (a warning this, by presentiment, against the Basedows and their modern imitators) “leaves the children’s minds silly,” (“Proposals for Raising a Colledge of Industry of all Useful Trades and Husbandry.” Lond., 1696, pp. 12, 14, 18.)  </p>

Herr Vissering, Professor of Political Economy in the University of Leyden, appears to have a suspicion of this when, in his “Handboek van Practische Staatshuishoudkunde, 1860-62,” which reproduces all the platitudes of vulgar economy, he strongly supports handicrafts against the factory system. </p> <p class="information1"> <b class="calibre10">[<em class="calibre11">Added in the 4th German edition</em></b> — The “hopelessly bewildering tangle of contradictory enactments” (S. 314) (present volume, p. 284) which English legislation called into life by means of the mutually conflicting Factory Acts, the Factory Acts Extension Act and the Workshops’ Act, finally became intolerable, and thus all legislative enactments on this subject were codified in the Factory and Workshop Act of 1878. Of course no detailed critique of this English industrial code now in effect can be presented here. The following remarks will have to suffice. The Act comprises: </p>
<p class="information1"> 1) <b class="calibre10">Textile Mills</b>. Here everything remains about as it was: children more than 10 years of age may work 5½ hours a day; or 6 hours and Saturday off; young persons and women, 10 hours on 5 days, and at most 6½ on Saturday. </p>
<p class="information1"> 2) <b class="calibre10">Non-Textile Factories</b>. Here the regulations are brought closer than before to those of No. 1, but there are still several exceptions which favour the capitalists and which in certain cases may be expanded by special permission of the Home Secretary. </p>
<p class="information1"> 3) <b class="calibre10">Workshops</b>, defined approximately as in the former Act; as for the children, young workers and women employed there, the workshops are about on a par with the non-textile factories, but again conditions are easier in details. </p>
<p class="information1"> 4) <b class="calibre10">Workshops</b> in which no children or young workers are employed, but only persons of both sexes above the age of 18; this category enjoy still easier conditions. </p>
<p class="information1"> 5) <b class="calibre10">Domestic Workshops</b>, where only members of the family are employed, in the family dwelling: still more elastic regulations and simultaneously the restriction that the inspector may, without special permission of the ministry or a court, enter only rooms not used also for dwelling purposes; and lastly unrestricted freedom for straw-plaiting and lace and glove-making by members of the family. With all its defects this Act, together with the Swiss Federal Factory Law of March 23, 1877, is still by far the best piece of legislation in this field. A comparison of it with the said Swiss federal law is of particular interest because it clearly demonstrates the merits and demerits of the two legislative methods — the English, “historical” method, which intervenes when occasion requires, and the continental method, which is built up on the traditions of the French Revolution and generalises more. Unfortunately, due to insufficient inspection personnel, the English code is still largely a dead letter with regard to its application to workshops. <em class="calibre11">— F. E.</em>] </p>

Good heavens! a nation divided into agricultural and commercial interests, calling itself sane; nay, styling itself enlightened and civilised, not only in spite of, but in consequence of this monstrous and unnatural division.” (David Urquhart, l.c., p. 119.)

Auflage, 1862, and especially the “Einleitung in die Naturgesetze des Feldbaus,” in the 1st Volume. To have developed from the point of view of natural science, the negative, i.e., destructive side of modern agriculture, is one of Liebig’s immortal merits. His summary, too, of the history of agriculture, although not free from gross errors, contains flashes of light. It is, however, to be regretted that he ventures on such haphazard assertions as the following: “By greater pulverising and more frequent ploughing, the circulation of air in the interior of porous soil is aided, and the surface exposed to the action of the atmosphere is increased and renewed; but it is easily seen that the increased yield of the land cannot be proportional to the labour spent on that land, but increases in a much smaller proportion. This law,” adds Liebig, “was first enunciated by John Stuart Mill in his ‘Principles of Pol. Econ.,’ Vol. 1, p. 17, as follows: ‘That the produce of land increases, <em class="calibre11">caeteris paribus</em>, in a diminishing ratio to the increase of the labourers employed’ (Mill here introduces in an erroneous form the law enunciated by Ricardo’s school, for since the ‘decrease of the labourers employed,’ kept even pace in England with the advance of agriculture, the law discovered in, and applied to, England, could have no application to that country, at all events), ‘is the universal law of agricultural industry.’ This is very remarkable, since Mill was ignorant of the reason for this taw.”  (Liebig, l.c., Bd. I., p. 143 and Note.) Apart from Liebig’s wrong interpretation of the word “labour,” by which word he understands something quite different from what Political Economy does, it is, in any case, “very remarkable” that he should make Mr. John Stuart Mill the first propounder of a theory which was first published by James Anderson in A.
